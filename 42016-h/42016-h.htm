<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE MYSTERY OF THE OLD DREDGE</h2>
<p>Marian Norton started, took one step backward,
then stood staring. Startled by this sudden
action, the spotted reindeer behind her
lunged backward to blunder into the brown
one that followed him, and this one was in
turn thrown against a white one that followed
the two. This set all three of them into
such a general mix-up that it was a full minute
before the girl could get them quieted and
could again allow her eyes to seek the object
of her alarm.</p>
<p>As she stood there her pulse quickened, her
cheeks flushed and she felt an all but irresistible
desire to turn and flee. Yet she held her
ground. Had she seen a flash of purple flame?
She had thought so. It had appeared to shoot
out from the side of the dark bulk that lay
just before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been my nerves,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Perhaps my eyes are seeing things.
T&rsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be strange. I came a long way
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She <i>had</i> come a long way over the Arctic
tundra that day. Starting but two mornings
before from her reindeer herd, close to a hundred
miles from Nome, Alaska, she had covered
fully two-thirds of that distance in two
days.</p>
<p>Her way had lead over low hills, across
streams whose waters ran clear and cold toward
the sea, down broad stretches of tundra
whose soft mosses had oozed moisture at her
every step. Here a young widgeon duck, ready
to begin his southward flight&mdash;for this was
the Arctic&rsquo;s autumn time&mdash;had stretched his
long neck to stare at her. Here a mother
white fox had yap-yaped at her, insolently and
unafraid. Here she had paused to pick a handful
of pink salmon berries or to admire a
particularly brilliant array of wild flowers,
which, but for her passing, might have been
&ldquo;Born to blush unseen and waste their fragrance
on the desert air.&rdquo; Yet always with the
three reindeers at her heels, she had pressed
onward toward Nome, the port and metropolis
of all that vast north country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>The black bulk that loomed out of the darkness
before her was a deserted dredging scow,
grounded on a sand bar of the Sinrock River.
At least she had thought the scow deserted.
Until now she had believed and hoped that
here she might spend the night, completing her
journey on the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Yes! Yes!
There can be no mistake. There it is again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sinking wearily down upon the damp grass,
she buried her face in her hands. She was so
tired she could cry, yet she must &ldquo;mush&rdquo; on
through the dark, over the soft, oozing tundra,
for fifteen more weary miles. Fifteen miles
further down the river was the Sinrock Mission.
Here she might hope to find a corral for
her deer, and food and rest for herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Marian did not cry. Born and bred in the
Arctic, she was made of such stern stuff as the
Arctic wilderness and the Arctic blizzard alone
can mould.</p>
<p>She did not mean to take chances with the
occupants of the old dredge. There was something
mysterious and uncanny about that purple
flame which she now saw shoot straight out, a
full two feet, to instantly disappear. She had
seen nothing like it before in the Arctic. As
she studied the outlines of the dredge, she realized
that the light was within it; that it
flashed across a small square window in the
side of the old scow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she reasoned, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to take
chances with them. I must go on down the
river. I can make Sinrock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to her reindeer, she tugged at their
lead straps. One at a time they started forward
until at last they again took up the weary
swish-swish across the tundra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Once Marian turned to look back. Again
she caught the flash of a purple flame.</p>
<p>Had she known how this purple flame was
to be mixed up with her own destiny, she
might have paused to look longer. As it was,
she gave herself over to wondering what sort
of people would take up their habitation in
that half tumbled-down dredge, and what their
weird light might signify.</p>
<p>She had heard of the strange rites performed
by those interesting child-people, the
Eskimos, in the worship of the spirits of dead
animals. For one of these, the &ldquo;Bladder Festival,&rdquo;
they saved all the bladders of polar bears,
walrus and seals which they had killed, and at
last, after four days of ceremony, committed
them again to the waters of the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They burn wild parsnip stalks in that festival,&rdquo;
Marian mused, &ldquo;but that purple flame
was not made by burning weeds. It was the brilliant
flame of a blue-hot furnace flaring up, or
something like that. Probably wasn&rsquo;t Eskimo
at all. Probably&mdash;well, it may be some Orientals
who have stolen away up here to worship
their idols by burning strange fires.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>She thought of all the foreign people who
had crossed the Pacific to take up their homes
in the far north city of Nome, which was just
forty miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Russians, and
members of nameless tribes,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself, as if half afraid they might hear her.
&ldquo;Might be any of these. Might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she broke off her thinking and
stopped short. Just before her a form loomed
out of the dark. Another and yet another
appeared.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood there rigid, scarcely
breathing. Then she threw back her head and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I was frightened
by some reindeer. Oh, well,&rdquo; she said,
after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;I might excuse
myself for that. I&rsquo;m tired out with marching
over this soggy tundra. Besides, I guess that
purple flame got on my nerves. All the same,&rdquo;
she avowed stoutly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll solve that mystery
yet. See if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>There for the time the subject was dismissed.
The presence of these few reindeer before her
told of more not far away, a whole herd of
them. Where there were reindeer there would
be herders, and herders lived in tents. Here
there would be a warm, dry place to rest and
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be the Sinrock herd,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p>In this she was right. Soon, off in the distance,
she caught the yellow glow of candlelight
shining through a tent wall. Fifteen
minutes later she was seated upon a rolled-up
sleeping bag, chatting gayly with two black-eyed
Eskimo girls who were keeping their
brothers&rsquo; tents while those worthies were out
looking for some stray fauns.</p>
<p>After her three reindeers had been relieved
of their packs and set free to graze, Marian
had dined on hardtack and juicy reindeer chops.
Then she crawled deep down into her soft reindeer
skin sleeping bag, to snatch a few hours
of rest before resuming her journey to Nome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Before her eyelids closed in sleep her tireless
brain went over the problem before her and
the purpose of her fatiguing journey. She had
come all this way to meet a relative whom she
had never seen&mdash;a cousin, Patsy Martin, from
Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; she whispered the word for the
hundredth time. &ldquo;Way down south. Imagine
a girl who was brought up down there coming
here for a winter to endure our cold, snow,
and blizzards. She&rsquo;s probably slim, willowy,
and tender as a baby; dresses in thin silks, and
all that. Why did father send her up here?
Looks like it was bad enough to have four
hundred reindeer to herd, without having a
sixteen year old cousin from Ken-tuck-ie to
look after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She yawned sleepily, yet her mind went on
thinking of her reindeer herd and her problems.
Though she had lived all but one year
of her life in the far north, she had never,
until two months before, spent a single night
in a reindeer herder&rsquo;s camp. But it was no
longer a novel experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Until recently her father had been a prosperous
merchant in Nome. Financial reverses
had come and he had been obliged to sell his
store. The reindeer herd, which he had taken
as payment for a debt, was the only wealth
he had saved from the crash. Following this,
his doctor had ordered him to leave the rigorous
climate of the North and to seek renewed
health in the States. Much as he regretted it,
he had been obliged to ask his daughter to
give up her studies and to take charge of the
herd until a favorable opportunity came for
selling it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that won&rsquo;t be soon, I guess,&rdquo; Marian
sighed. &ldquo;Reindeer herds are a drug on the
market. Trouble is, it&rsquo;s too hard to dispose of
the meat. And if you can&rsquo;t sell reindeer meat
you can&rsquo;t make any money. Now, added to
this, comes this cousin, Patsy Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Her father had written that Patsy was given
to over-study, and that Mr. Martin, her uncle,
thinking that a year in the northern wilds
would do her good, had asked permission to
send her up to be with Marian. Marian&rsquo;s
father had consented, and Patsy was due on
the next boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be company for you,&rdquo; her father had
written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wonder if she will?&rdquo; Marian sighed
again. &ldquo;Oh, well, no use to be a pessimist,&rdquo;
and at that she turned over and fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was a surprised Marian who three days
later found herself caught in the firm embrace
of her cousin, Patsy. Patsy was two years
younger than Marian. There could be no missing
the fact that she was much slimmer and
more graceful, and that there was strength in
her slender arms was testified to by her warm
embrace.</p>
<p>When at last Marian got a look at Patsy&rsquo;s
face, she found it almost as brown as her own.
And as for freckles, there could scarcely have
been a greater number on one person&rsquo;s face.
Her mouth, too, had lines that Marian liked.
It was a firm, determined little mouth that
said: &ldquo;When I have a hill to climb I <i>run</i> up it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Never had Marian beheld such a wealth of
color as was displayed in Patsy&rsquo;s winter wardrobe.
Orange and red sweaters; great, broad
scarfs of mixed grays; gay tams; short plaid
skirts; heavy brown corduroy knickers; these
and many other garments of exquisite workmanship
and design were spread out before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fun of it all is,&rdquo; giggled Patsy,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to play we&rsquo;re twins and wear
one another&rsquo;s clothes. You&rsquo;ve got a spotted
fawnskin parka, I know you have. I&rsquo;m going
to wear that, right away&mdash;this afternoon.
Going to have my picture taken in it and send
it back to my school friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Marian. &ldquo;You can have
anything I own. I&rsquo;m heavier than you are, but
arctic clothing doesn&rsquo;t fit very tight, so I guess
it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to clinch the bargain, she wound an
orange colored scarf about her neck and went
strutting across the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>A half hour later, while Patsy was out having
her picture taken, Marian walked slowly up
and down the room. She was thinking, and
her thoughts were long, long thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to like her more and more. But it&rsquo;s going to be
hard for her sometimes, fearfully hard. When
the blizzards sweep in from the north and we&rsquo;re
all shut in; when no one comes and no one goes,
and the nights are twenty hours long; when the
dogs howl their lonesome song&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to
be hard for her then. But I&rsquo;ll do the best I
can for her. Her father was right&mdash;it will
do her a world of good. It will teach her the
slow and steady patience of those who live in
the North, and that&rsquo;s a good thing to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Three weeks later the two girls, toiling
wearily along after two reindeer sleds, approached
the black bulk of the old scow in the
river, the one in which Marian had seen the
mysterious purple flame. Again it was night.
They were on their way north to the reindeer
herd. Traveling over the first soft snow of
winter, they had made twenty miles that day.
For the last hour Patsy had not uttered a single
word. She had tramped doggedly after the
sled. Only her drooping shoulders told how
weary she was. Marian had hoped against hope
that they would this time find the old dredge
deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make a nice dry place to camp,&rdquo;
she said to herself, as she brought her reindeer
to a halt and stood studying the dark bulk.
Patsy dropped wearily down upon a loaded sled.</p>
<p>Just as Marian was about to give the word
to go forward, there flashed across the square
window a jet of purple flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as much as I do; only I know
it&rsquo;s there in that old dredge. And since it&rsquo;s
there, we can&rsquo;t stop here for the night. We
must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Patsy half sobbed.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t know how tired I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Marian softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been just that way; but we dare not stop here.
The people in the old scow might have dogs and
they would attack our reindeer. We must go on;
five miles more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp beneath the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Patsy, with a burst of
determination. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they moved slowly forward, but neither
of them forgot the purple flame. Three times
they saw it flash across the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place must be haunted,&rdquo; Marian sighed
as she turned to give her full attention to the
lagging reindeer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />PATSY FROM KENTUCKY</h2>
<p>Some five miles from the old dredge Marian
stopped her reindeer, gazed about her for a
moment, then said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; cried Patsy. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we freeze?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freeze? No, we&rsquo;ll be safe as a bug in a rug.
Just you sit down on a sled until I unpack this
one. After that I&rsquo;ll picket out the reindeer and
get supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the sled Marian dragged a sheet iron
affair which she called a Yukon stove. With dry
moss, dug from beneath the snow, and wood
brought on the sled, she kindled a fire. They
had no shelter, but the glow of the fire cheered
Patsy immeasurably. When the smell of frying
bacon and warming red beans reached her she
was ready to execute a little dance of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Supper over, Marian took a small trench
shovel, salvaged by a friend from the great war,
and scraped away the snow from above the soft,
dry tundra moss. Over this cleared space she
spread a square of canvas. Then, untying a
thong about a deerskin sleeping bag, she allowed
the bag to slowly unroll itself along the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;the bed is made.
No need to pull down the shades. We&rsquo;ll get off
our outer garments and hop right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy looked at her in astonishment. Then,
seeing her take off first her mackinaw, then her
sweater, she followed suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Marian as they reached the
proper stage of disrobing, &ldquo;you do it like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting down upon the canvas, she thrust her
feet into the sleeping bag, then began to work
her way into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she directed, &ldquo;we can do it best
together. It&rsquo;s just big enough for two. I had it
made that way on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Patsy dropped to the place beside her. Then
together they burrowed their way into the depths
of the bag until only their eyes and noses were
uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soft!&rdquo; murmured Patsy as she wound
an arm about her cousin&rsquo;s neck, then lay staring
up at the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How warm!&rdquo; she whispered again five minutes
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Marian whispered, as though they
were sleeping at home and might disturb the
household by speaking aloud. &ldquo;You see, this
bag is made of the long haired winter skins of
reindeer. The hair is a solid mat more than an
inch thick. The skin keeps out the wind. With
the foot and the sides of it sewed up tight, you
can&rsquo;t possibly get cold, even if you sleep on the
frozen ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit of use writing that to my
friends. They simply wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>For a little time, with arms twined about one
another, the cousins lay there in silence. Each,
busy with her own thoughts, was not at all
conscious of the bonds of human affection which
the vast silence of the white wilderness was even
now weaving about them. Bonds far stronger
than their arms about one another&rsquo;s neck, these
were to carry them together through many a
wild and mysterious adventure.</p>
<p>As if in anticipation of all this, Patsy snuggled
a bit closer to Marian and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this is going to be great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; Marian answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will we really herd the reindeer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Marian, &ldquo;at least not any more
than we wish to. You see, we have three Eskimo
herders with us, and Attatak, a girl who cooks
for them. They do most of the work. All we
have to do is to finance the herd and sort of
supervise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, the Eskimo people are really child-people.
They have had many strange customs in
the past that don&rsquo;t fit now. In their old village
life of hunting and fishing, it was an unwritten
law that if one man had food and another had
none, it must be shared. That won&rsquo;t work now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one time of year that we can
get food into this herding ground; that is summer.
We freight it up the river and store it for
winter&rsquo;s use. That gives us a big supply of
provisions in the fall. There are two Eskimo
villages thirty miles away. If there were no
white people about, our good-hearted herders
would share our supplies with the villagers as
often as they came around. Before the winter
was half through they would be out of supplies.
They would then have to live on reindeer meat,
and that would be hard on our herd. In fact,
we would soon have no herd. So that is the
reason we are going to spend a winter on the
tundra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will we live like this?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; laughed Marian. &ldquo;We have tents
for this time of year. In a month we will move
into the most interesting houses you ever saw.
We&rsquo;ll reserve that as a surprise for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; sighed Patsy, as she suddenly
became conscious of the aches in her legs. &ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;s going to be grand, if only I get so I can
stand the travel as you do. Do you think I ever
will?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will&mdash;in less than a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Patsy thoughtfully, &ldquo;down
where I came from we think we exercise an
awful lot. We swim and row, ride horseback,
play tennis and basket-ball, and go on hikes.
But, after all, that was just play&mdash;sort of skipping
&rsquo;round. This&mdash;this is the real thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving her cousin an energetic good-night
hug, she closed her eyes and was soon fast
asleep.</p>
<p>Marian did not fall asleep at once. Her mind
was working over the mystery of the purple
flame. What was it? What had caused it?
Who were the persons back there in the old
dredge, and why had they come there? Such
were some of the problems that crowded her
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The old dredge had been there for years. It
was but one of the many monuments to men&rsquo;s
folly in their greedy search for gold. These
monuments&mdash;dredges, derricks, sluice-boxes,
crushers, smelters, and who knows what others&mdash;lined
the beaches and rivers about Nome. The
bed of the Sinrock River was known to run
fairly rich in gold. Someone had imagined that
he might become rich by dredging the mud at
the bottom of the river and washing it for gold.
The scheme had failed. Doubtless the owner of
the dredge had gone into bankruptcy. At any
rate, here was the old dredge with its long beams
and gaping iron bucket still dangling in air,
rotting to decay. And here within this tomblike
wreck had appeared the purple flame.</p>
<p>It had not been like anything Marian had seen
before. &ldquo;Almost like lightning,&rdquo; she mused,
sleepily.</p>
<p>Being a healthy girl with a clean mind, she
did not long puzzle her brain about the uncanny
mystery of the weird light, but busied her mind
with more practical problems. If these makers
of the purple flame were to remain long at the
dredge, how were they to live? Too often in the
past, the answer to such a question had been,
&ldquo;By secretly preying upon the nearest herd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>The Sinrock herd had been moved some distance
away. Marian&rsquo;s own herd was now the
nearest one to the old dredge. &ldquo;And when we
move into winter quarters it will be five miles
nearer. Oh, well!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use
borrowing trouble. It&rsquo;s probably some miners
going up the river to do assessment work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; her busy mind questioned, &ldquo;what
about the purple flame? Why have they already
stayed there three weeks? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture she fell asleep, to awake when
the first streaks of dawn were casting fingers of
light across the snowy tundra.</p>
<p>She crept softly from her sleeping bag, jumped
into her clothes, and was in the act of lighting
the fire when a faint sound of heavy breathing
caused her to turn her head. To her surprise she
saw Patsy, clothed only in those garments that
had served as her sleeping gown, doing a
strange, whirling, bare-footed fling of calisthenics,
with the sleeping bag as her mat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear to have quite recovered,&rdquo; Marian
laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just seeing if I was all here,&rdquo; Patsy laughed
in turn, as she dropped down upon the bag and
began drawing on her stockings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; she puffed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s invigorating;
good as a cold plunge in the sea. What do we
have for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sour-dough flapjacks and maple syrup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-um! Make me ten,&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy,
redoubling her efforts to get herself dressed.</p>
<p>That night Marian made a discovery that set
her nerves a-tremble to the very roots of her hair
and, in spite of the Arctic chill, brought beads
of perspiration out on the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>As on the previous night, they had camped
out upon the open tundra. This night, however,
they had found a sheltered spot beside a clump
of willows that lined a stream. The stream ran
between low, rolling hills. Over those hills they
had been passing when darkness fell. Now, as
Marian crept into the sleeping bag, she saw the
nearer hills rising like cathedral domes above
her. She heard the ceaseless rustle of willow
leaves that, caught by an early frost, still clung
to their branches. This rustle, together with the
faint breeze that fanned her cheeks, had all but
lulled her to sleep. Suddenly she sat upright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then, a
moment later, she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, yes&mdash;there it is again. Who would
believe it? Lightning in the Arctic, and on such
a night as this. Twenty below zero and clear
as a bell! Not a cloud in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubbing her brow to clear her mind from the
cobweb of dreams that had been forming there,
she stared again at the crest of the hill.</p>
<p>Then, swiftly, silently, that she might not
waken her cousin, she crept from the sleeping
bag. Donning her fur parka and drawing on
knickers and deerskin boots, she hurried away
from camp and up the hill, thinking as she
did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not lightning. I don&rsquo;t know what it
is, but in the name of all that&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m going
to come nearer solving that mystery than ever I
did before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Half way up the hill she found a snow blown
gully, and up this she crept, half hidden by the
shadows. Nearing the crest, a half mile from
her camp, she dropped on hands and knees and
crawled forward a hundred yards. Then, like
some hunter who has stolen upon his game, she
propped herself on her elbows and stared straight
ahead.</p>
<p>In spite of her expectations, she gasped at
what she saw. A purple flame, now six inches
in length, now a foot, now two feet, darted out
of space, then receded, then flared up again.
Three feet above the surface of the snow, it
appeared to hang in midair like some ghost fire.</p>
<p>Marian&rsquo;s heart beat wildly. Her nerves
tingled, her knees trembled, and open-mouthed,
without the power to move, she stared at this
strange apparition.</p>
<p>This spell lasted for a moment. Then, with a
half audible exclamation of disgust, she dropped
limply to the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside a tent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tent was so like
the snow and the sky that I couldn&rsquo;t see it at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>As her eyes became accustomed to this version
of her discovery she was able to make out the
outlines of the tent and even to recognize a dog
sleeping beside it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the shadow of a person began dancing
on the wall of the tent. So rapid were the
flashes of the purple flame, so flickering and
distorted was this image, that it seemed more
the shadow of a ghost than of a human being.
A second shadow joined the first. The two of
them appeared to do some wild dance. Then,
of a sudden, all was dark. The purple flame had
vanished.</p>
<p>A moment later a yellow light flared up. Then
a steady light gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lighted a candle,&rdquo; was Marian&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on this side of them, for now they cast no
shadows. Are they all men? Or, are there
some women? How many are there? Two, or
more than two? They are following us. I&rsquo;d
swear to that. I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Again she thought of the stories she had
heard of ne&rsquo;er-do-wells who dogged the tracks
of reindeer herds like camp followers, and lived
upon the deer that had strayed too far from the
main herd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Marian mused, &ldquo;they have heard
that father&rsquo;s herd is to be run this winter by
two inexperienced girls. Perhaps they think we
will be easy. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; she set her lips tight,
&ldquo;perhaps we will, and perhaps not. We shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went stealing back to her camp and
crept shivering into the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>She slept very little that night. The camp of
the mysterious strangers was too close; the perplexing
problems that lay before her too serious
to permit of that. She was glad enough when
she caught the first faint flush of dawn in the
east and knew that a new day was dawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;we make our
own camp. There is comfort in that. Let the
future take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cast one glance toward the hill, but seeing
no movement there, she began to search the
ground for dry moss for kindling a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Soon she had a little yellow flame glowing in
her Yukon stove. The feeble flame soon grew
to a bright red, and in a little while the coffee
pot was singing its song of merry defiance to the
Arctic chill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />MARIAN FACES A PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Marian buried her hand in the thick warm
coat of the spotted reindeer that stood by her
side and, shading her eyes, gazed away at the
distant hills. A brown spot had appeared at the
crest of the third hill to her right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another and another,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Reindeer or caribou? I wonder. If it&rsquo;s caribou,
perhaps Terogloona can get one of them
with his rifle. It would help out our food supply.
But if it&rsquo;s reindeer&mdash;&rdquo; her brow wrinkled at
the thought, &ldquo;reindeer might mean trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant something happened that
brought her hand to her side. Quickly unstrapping
her field glasses, she put them to her eyes.</p>
<p>A fourth object had appeared on the crest.
Even with the naked eye one might tell that this
one was not like the other three. He was
lighter in color and lacked the lace-like suggestion
against the sky which meant broad spreading
antlers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;All of them reindeer,
and the last one&rsquo;s a sled deer. His antlers
have been cut off so he&rsquo;ll travel better. And that
means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pursed her lips in deep thought as the
furrows in her brow deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Perhaps
it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything after all. Perhaps
they&rsquo;re just a bunch of strays. Who knows?
But a sled reindeer?&rdquo; she argued with herself.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t often stray away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stood staring at the distant
hillcrest. Then, seizing her drive line, she spoke
to her deer. As he bounded away she leaped
nimbly upon the sled and went skimming along
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
not our deer, that&rsquo;s sure. Whose are they?
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re about to find out. A circle
across that long valley, then a stiff climb up a
gully, will just about bring us to their position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later she found herself atop
the first elevation. For the time, out of sight
of the strange reindeer, she had an opportunity
to glance back down the valley where her own
herd was peacefully feeding. Her eyes lighted
up as she looked. It was indeed a beautiful
sight. Winter had come, for she and Patsy
Martin had now been following the herd for
three months. Winter, having buried deep beneath
the snow every trace of the browns and
greens of summer, had left only deep purple
shadows and pale yellow lights over mountain,
hill and tundra. In the midst of these lights
and shadows, such as are not seen save upon
a sun-scorched desert or the winter-charmed
Arctic, her little herd of some four hundred deer
stood out as if painted on a canvas or done in
bas-relief with wood or stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like anything in the world,&rdquo; said
Marian, &ldquo;and I love it. Oh, how I do love it!
How I wish I could paint it as it really is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>As she rode on up the valley her mind went
over the months that had passed and the problems
she and Patsy now faced.</p>
<p>Great as was her love for the Arctic, fond as
she was of its wild, free life, her father had
made other plans for her; plans that could not
be carried out so long as they were in possession
of the herd. This seemed to make the sale of
the herd an urgent necessity. Every letter from
her father that came to her over hundreds of
miles of dog-sled and reindeer trail, suggested
some possible means of disposing of the herd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> sell by spring,&rdquo; his last letter had
said. &ldquo;Not that I am in immediate need of
money, but you must get back to school. One
year out there in the wilderness, with Patsy for
your companion, will do no harm, but it must
not go on. The doctor says I cannot return to
the North for four or five years at the least.
So, somehow, we must sell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sell! Sell!&rdquo; Marian repeated, almost savagely.
It seemed to her that there could be no
selling the herd. There was only a limited
market for reindeer meat. Miners here and
there bought it. The mining cities bought it, but
of late the increase to one hundred thousand
reindeer in Alaska had overloaded the market.
A little meat could be shipped to the States, there
to be served at great club luncheons and in
palatial hotels, but the demand was not large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell?&rdquo; she questioned, &ldquo;how can we sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little she knew how soon a possible answer
to that question would come. Not knowing, she
visioned herself following the herd year after
year, while all those beautiful, wonderful months
she had had a taste of, and now dreamed of by
day and night, faded from her thoughts.</p>
<p>She had spent one year under the shadows of
a great university. Marvelous new thoughts had
come to her that year. Friendships had been
made, such friendships as she in her northern
wilds had never dreamed of. The stately towers
of the university even now appeared to loom
before her, and again she seemed to hear the
melodious chimes of the bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I must go back. I must!
I must!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>And yet Marian was not unhappy. For the
present she would not be any other place than
where she was. It was a charming life, this
wandering life of the reindeer herder. During
the short summer, and even into the frosts of
fall and winter, they lived in tents, and like
nomads of the desert, wandered from place to
place, always seeking the freshest water, the
greenest grass, the tallest willow bushes. But
when winter truly came swooping down upon
them, they went to a spot chosen months before,
the center of rich feeding grounds where the
ground beneath the snow was green-white with
&ldquo;reindeer moss.&rdquo; Here they made a more
permanent camp. After that there remained
but the task of defending the herd from wolves
and other marauders, and of driving the herd
to camp each day, that they might not wander
too far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>As for Patsy, she had fairly revelled in it all.
Reared in a city apartment where a chirping
sparrow gave the only touch of nature, she had
come to this wilderness with a great thirst for
knowledge of the out-of-doors. Each day
brought some new revelation to her. The snow
buntings, ptarmigans and ravens; the foxes,
caribou and reindeer; even the occasional prowling
wolves, all were her teachers. From them
she learned many secrets of wild nature.</p>
<p>Of course there had been long, shut-in days,
when the wind swept the tundra, and the snow,
appearing to rest nowhere, whirled on and on.
Such days were lonely ones. Letters were weeks
in coming and arrived but seldom. All these
things gave the energetic city lass some blue
days, but even then she never complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Her health was greatly improved. Gone was
the nervous twitch of eyelids that told of too
many hours spent pouring over books. The
summer freckles had been replaced by ruddy
brown, such as only Arctic winds and an occasional
freeze can impart. As for her muscles,
they were like iron bands. Never in the longest
day&rsquo;s tramp did she complain of weariness. With
the quick adaptability of a bright and cheerful
girl, she had become a part of the wild world
which surrounded her. The expression of her
lips, too, was somehow changed. Firmness and
determination were still written there, but certain
lines had been added; lines of patience that
said louder than words: &ldquo;I have learned one
great lesson; that one may run uphill, but that
mountains must be climbed slowly, patiently,
circle by circle, till the summit is reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in winter camp now. As Marian
thought of it she smiled. At no other spot in
all Alaska was there another such camp as hers.
Marian, as you know if you have read our other
book, &ldquo;The Blue Envelope,&rdquo; had, some two
years before, spent the short summer months of
the Arctic in Siberia, across from Alaska. Much
against her own wishes, she had spent a part
of the winter there. Someone has said &ldquo;there
is no great loss without some small gain&rdquo;; and
while Marian had endured hardships and known
moments of peril in Siberia, from the strange
and interesting tribes there she had learned
some lessons of real value regarding winter
camps in the Arctic. Upon making her own
camp she had put this knowledge into practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>They were now in winter camp. As Marian
thought of this, then thought of the four strange
reindeer on the ridge above, her brow again
showed wrinkles of anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s herd,&rdquo; she said
fiercely, clenching her fists, &ldquo;if it is!&rdquo; In her
words there was a world of feeling.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the reindeer industry in
Alaska, the problem of feed grounds for the
deer had been exceedingly simple. There were
the broad stretches of tundra, a hundred square
miles for every reindeer. Help yourself. Every
mile of it was matted deep with rich moss; every
stream lined in summer with tender willow
leaves. If you chanced to sight another small
herd in your wandering, you went to right or
left, and so avoided them. There was room
for all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Now things were vastly changed. One hundred
thousand deer ranged the tundra. Reindeer
moss, eaten away in a single season, requires
four or five years to grow again in abundance.
Back, back, farther and farther back from shore
and river the herds had been pushed, until now
it was difficult indeed to transport food to the
herders.</p>
<p>With these conditions arising, the rivalry
between owners for good feeding ground grew
intense. Many and bitter were the feuds that
had arisen between owners. There was not the
best of feeling between Bill Scarberry, another
owner, and her father; Marian knew that all
too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now maybe his herd is coming into our
feeding ground,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>It was true that the Government Agent
attempted to allot feeding grounds. The valley
her deer were feeding upon had been written
down in his book as her winter range; but when
one is many days&rsquo; travel from even the fringe
of civilization, when one is the herder of but
four hundred deer, and only a girl at that, when
an overriding owner of ten thousand deer comes
driving in his vast herd to lick up one&rsquo;s little
pasture in a week or two, what is there to do?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>These were the bitter thoughts that ran
through the girl&rsquo;s mind as she rode up the
valley.</p>
<p>The pasture to the right and left of them, and
to the north, had been alloted for so many miles
that it was out of the question to think of
breaking winter camp and freighting supplies to
some new range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;we are here, and
here we stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she known the strange circumstances
that would cause her to alter this decision, she
might have been startled at the grim humor of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />THE RANGE ROBBER</h2>
<p>Just as Marian finished thinking these things
through, her reindeer gave a final leap which
brought him squarely upon the crest of the
highest ridge. From this point, so it seemed to
her, she could view the whole world.</p>
<p>As her eyes automatically sought the spot
where the four reindeer had first appeared, a
stifled cry escaped her lips. The valley at the
foot of that slope was a moving sea of brown
and white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great herd!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Scarberry&rsquo;s
herd!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>The presence of this great herd at that spot
meant almost certain disaster to her own little
herd. Even if the herds were kept apart&mdash;which
seemed extremely unlikely&mdash;her pasture
would be ruined, and she had no other place to
go. If the herds did mix, it would take weeks
of patient toil to separate them&mdash;toil on the
part of all. Knowing Scarberry as she did, she
felt certain that little of the work would be done
by either his herders or himself. All up and
down the coast and far back into the interior,
Scarberry was known for the selfishness, the
brutality and injustice of his actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such men should not be allowed upon the
Alaskan range,&rdquo; she hissed through tightly set
teeth. &ldquo;But here he is. Alaska is young. It&rsquo;s
a new and thrilling little world all of itself. He
who comes here must take his chance. Some
day, the dishonest men will be controlled or
driven out. For the present it&rsquo;s a fight. And
we must fight. Girls though we are, we <i>must</i>
fight. And we will! We will!&rdquo; she stamped the
snow savagely. &ldquo;Bill Scarberry shall not have
our pasture without a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Had she been a heroine in a modern novel of
the North, she would have leaped upon her
saddle-deer, put the spurs to his side, and gone
racing to the camp of the savage Bill Scarberry,
then and there to tell him exactly what her
rights were and to dare him to trespass against
them. Since, so far as we know, there are no
saddle-deer in Alaska, and no deer-saddles to be
purchased anywhere; and since Marian was an
ordinary American girl, with a good degree of
common sense and caution, and not a heroine
at all in the vulgar sense of the word, she stood
exactly where she was and proceeded to examine
the herd through her field glass.</p>
<p>If she had hoped against hope that this was
not Scarberry&rsquo;s herd at all, but some other herd
that was passing to winter quarters, this hope
was soon dispelled. The four deer upon the
ridge, having strayed some distance from the
main herd, were now only a few hundred yards
away. She at once made out their markings.
Two notches, one circular and one triangular,
had been cut from the gristly portion of the
right ear of each deer. This brutal manner of
marking, so common a few years earlier, had
been kept up by Scarberry, who had as little
thought for the suffering of his deer as he had
for the rights of others. The deer owned by
the Government, and Marian&rsquo;s own deer, were
marked by aluminum tags attached to their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Scarberry&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Marian concluded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his herd, and he brought them
here. If they had strayed away by accident
and his herders had come after them, they
would be driving them back. Now they&rsquo;re just
wandering along the edge of the herd, keeping
them together. There comes one of them after
the four strays. No good seeing him now. It
wouldn&rsquo;t accomplish anything, and I might say
too much. I&rsquo;ll wait and think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning her deer, for a time she drove along
the crest of the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;if he&rsquo;s already taken up quarters in the old
miner&rsquo;s cabin down there in the willows on the
bank of the Little Soquina River. Yes,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the smoke of his fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she stormed, enraged at the cool
complacency of the thing, &ldquo;to think that any
man could be so mean. He has thousands of
deer, and a broad, rich range. He&rsquo;s afraid the
range may be scant in the spring and his deer
become poor for the spring shipping market, so
he saves it by driving his herd over here for a
month or two, that it may eat all the moss we
have and leave us to make a perilous or even
fatal drive to distant pastures. That, or to see
our deer starve before our very eyes. It&rsquo;s
unfair! It&rsquo;s brutally inhuman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she sighed a moment later, &ldquo;I
suppose the men up here are not all to blame.
Seems like there is something about the cold and
darkness, the terrible lonesomeness of it all, that
makes men like wolves that prowl in the scrub
forests&mdash;fierce, bloodthirsty and savage. But
that will do for sentiment. Scarberry must not
have his way. He must not feed down our
pasture if there is a way to prevent it. And
I think there is! I&rsquo;m almost sure. I must talk
to Patsy about it. It would mean something
rather hard for her, but she&rsquo;s a brave little soul,
God bless her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Then she spoke to her reindeer and went
racing away down the slope toward the camp.</p>
<p>It was a strange looking camp that awaited
Marian&rsquo;s coming. Two dome shaped affairs of
canvas were all but hidden in a clump of willows,
surrounded by deer sleds and a small canvas tent
for supplies&mdash;surely a strange camp for Alaskan
reindeer herders.</p>
<p>But how comfortable were those dome shaped
igloos! Marian had learned to make them during
that eventful journey with the reindeer
Chukches in Siberia.</p>
<p>Winter skins of reindeer are cheap, very
cheap in Alaska. Being light, portable and
warm, Marian had used many of them in the
construction of this winter camp. Her heart
warmed with the prospect of perfect comfort,
and drawing the harness from her reindeer, she
turned it loose to graze. Then she parted the
flap to the igloo which she and Patsy shared.</p>
<p>Something of the suppressed excitement which
came to her from the discovery of the rival herd
must still have shown in her face, for as Patsy
turned from her work of preparing a meal to
look at Marian she noticed the look on her face
and exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Did you see it, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I know what you mean,&rdquo;
said Marian, puzzled by her question. Where
had Patsy been? Surely the herd could not be
seen from the camp, and she had not said she
was going far from it; in fact, she had been
left to watch camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough,&rdquo; continued Marian, &ldquo;to
make me dreadfully angry. Something&rsquo;s got to
be done about it. Right away, too. As soon
as we have a bite to eat we&rsquo;ll talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d feel that way about it,&rdquo; said
Patsy. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame that they should
hang about this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Patsy,&rdquo; exclaimed Marian, seizing
her by the shoulder and turning her about,
&ldquo;what are we&mdash;what are <i>you</i> talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; Patsy stammered, mystified,
&ldquo;you just come out here and I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Dragging her cousin out of the igloo and
around the end of the willows, she pointed
toward a hillcrest.</p>
<p>There, atop the hill, stood a newly erected tent,
and at that very moment its interior was lighted
by a strange purple light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian.
&ldquo;More trouble. Or is it all one? Is it Bill
Scarberry who lights that mysterious flame?
Does he think that by doing that he can frighten
us from our range?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Scarberry?&rdquo; questioned Patsy, &ldquo;who
is he, and what has he to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on into the igloo and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
said Marian, shivering as a gust of wind swept
down from the hill.</p>
<p>As they turned to go back Patsy said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terogloona came in a few minutes ago. He
said to tell you that another deer was gone.
This time it is a spotted two-year-old.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That makes seven that have disappeared in
the last six weeks. If that keeps up we won&rsquo;t
need to sell our herd; it will vanish like snow
in the spring. It can&rsquo;t be wolves. They leave
the bones behind. You can always tell when
they&rsquo;re about. I wonder if those strange people
of the purple flame are living off our deer? I&rsquo;ve
a good mind to go right up there and accuse
them of it. But no, I can&rsquo;t now; there are other
more important things before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be more important?&rdquo; asked
Patsy in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Marian, as she
parted the flap of the igloo and disappeared
within.</p>
<p>A half hour later they were munching biscuits
and drinking steaming coffee. Marian had said
not a single word about the problems and adventures
that lay just before them. Patsy asked no
questions. She knew that the great moment of
confiding came when they were snugly tucked
in beneath blankets and deerskins in the strangest
little sleeping room in all the world. Knowing
this, she was content to wait until night
for Marian to tell her all about this important
matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />PLANNING A PERILOUS JOURNEY</h2>
<p>The house in which the girls lived was a
cunningly built affair. Eight long poles, brought
from the distant river, had been lashed together
at one end. Then they had all been raised to an
upright position and spread apart like the pole
of an Indian&rsquo;s tepee. Canvas was spread over
this circle of poles. That there might be more
room in the tent, curved willow branches were
lashed to the poles. These held the canvas away
in a circle. After this had been accomplished
the whole inside was lined with deerskins. Only
an opening at the top was left for the passing
of smoke from the Yukon stove. The stove stood
in the front center of the house. Back of it
was a platform six by eight feet. This platform
was surrounded on all four sides and above by a
second lining of deerskin. This platform formed
the floor and the deerskins the walls of a little
room within the skin house. This was the
sleeping room of Marian and Patsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>A more cozy place could scarcely be imagined.
Even with the thermometer at forty below, and
the wind howling about the igloo, this room was
warm as toast. With the sleeping bag for a
bed, and with a heavy deerskin rug and blankets
piled upon them, the girls could sleep in perfect
comfort.</p>
<p>In this cozy spot, with one arm thrown loosely
about her cousin&rsquo;s neck, Marian lay that night
for a full five minutes in perfect silent repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patsy,&rdquo; she said, as her arm suddenly tightened
about her cousin&rsquo;s neck in an affectionate
hug, &ldquo;would you be terribly afraid to stay here
all by yourself with the Eskimos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how long?&rdquo; Patsy faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. Perhaps a week,
perhaps three. In the Arctic one never knows.
Things happen. There are blizzards; rivers can
not be crossed; there is no food to be had;
who knows what may happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Patsy slowly, &ldquo;with Attatak
here I think I shouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Marian with evident reluctance,
&ldquo;that I should take Attatak with me.
I&rsquo;d like to take old Terogloona. He&rsquo;d be more
help; but at a time like this he can&rsquo;t leave the
herd. He&rsquo;s absolutely faithful&mdash;would give his
life for us. Father once saved him from drowning
when a skin boat was run down by a motor
launch. An Eskimo never forgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely you talk,&rdquo; said Patsy suddenly.
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is the purple flame as serious an
affair as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; answered Marian. &ldquo;That may
become serious. They may be killing our deer,
but we haven&rsquo;t caught them at it. That, for the
present, is just an interesting mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you&mdash;where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Patsy,&rdquo; said Marian thoughtfully;
&ldquo;do you remember the radio message we picked
up three days ago&mdash;the one from the Government
Agent, sent from Nome to Fairbanks?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Patsy did remember. She had spent many
interesting hours listening in on the compact but
powerful radio set her father had presented to
her as a parting gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he say he was leaving Nome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 5th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means he&rsquo;ll be at the Siman&rsquo;s trading
station on about the 12th. And Siman&rsquo;s is the
spot on the Nome-Fairbanks trail that is nearest
to us. By fast driving and good luck I can get
there before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you?&rdquo; persisted Patsy.</p>
<p>Then Marian confided to her cousin the new
trouble they were facing, the almost certain loss
of their range, with all the calamities that would
follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I can see the Agent before he passes
on to Fairbanks I am sure he would deputize
someone to come over here and compel Scarberry
to take his herd from our range. If I
can&rsquo;t do that, then I don&rsquo;t see that we have a
single chance. We might as well&mdash;as well&mdash;&rdquo;
there was a catch in her voice&mdash;&ldquo;as well make
Scarberry a present of our herd and go on our
way back to Nome. We&rsquo;d be flat broke; not a
penny in the world! And father&mdash;father would
not have a single chance for a fresh start. But
we will be ruined soon enough if we try to put
up a fight all by ourselves, for Scarberry&rsquo;s too
strong; he&rsquo;s got three herders to our one. The
Agent is our only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time after this speech all was
silence, and Marian was beginning to think that
Patsy had gone to sleep. Then she felt her soft
warm hand steal into hers as she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not afraid. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stay, and I&rsquo;ll
do all I can to keep that thief and his deer off
our range until you get back. I&rsquo;ll do it, too!
See if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy&rsquo;s southern fighting blood was up. At
such a time she felt equal to anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old dear; only be careful.&rdquo; Marian
gave her a rousing hug, then whispered as she
drew the deerskins about her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep now. I must be away before
dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A JOURNEY WELL BEGUN</h2>
<p>Two hours before the tardy dawn, Marian
and Attatak were away. With three tried and
trusted reindeer&mdash;Spot, Whitie, and Brownie&mdash;they
were to attempt a journey of some hundreds
of miles. Across trackless wilderness they must
lay their course by the stars until the Little
Kalikumf River was reached. After this it was
a straight course down a well marked trail to
the trading station, providing the river was
fully frozen over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>This river was one of the many problems
they must face. There were others. Stray dogs
might attack their deer; they might cross the
track of a mother wolf and her hungry pack
of half grown cubs; a blizzard might overtake
them and, lacking the guiding light of the stars,
they might become lost and wander aimlessly on
the tundra until cold and hunger claimed them
for their own. But of all these, Marian thought
most of the river. Would it be frozen over, or
would they be forced to turn back after covering
all those weary miles and enduring the
hardships?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak,&rdquo; she said to the native girl, &ldquo;they
say the Little Kalikumf River has rapids in it
by the end of a glacier and that no man dares
shoot those rapids. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; (yes) answered Attatak. &ldquo;Spirit
of water angry at ice cut away far below. Want
to shoot rapids; boats and man run beneath that
ice. Soon smashed boat, killed man. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite enough, Marian thought; but
somehow they must pass these rapids whether
they were frozen over or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s still far away.
First comes the fight with tundra, hills and
sweeping winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patting her reindeer on the side, she sent him
flying up the valley while she raced along beside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>These reindeer were wonderful steeds. No
food need be carried for them. They found
their own food beneath the snow when day was
done. A hundred miles in a day, over a smooth
trail, was not too much for them. Soft snow&mdash;the
wind-blown, blizzard-sifted snow that was
like granulated sugar&mdash;did not trouble them.
They trotted straight on. There was no need to
search out a water hole that they might slake
their thirst; they scooped up mouthfuls of snow
as they raced along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful old friends,&rdquo; murmured Marian
as she reached out a hand to touch her spotted
leader. &ldquo;There are those who say a dog team
is better. Bill Scarberry, they say, never drives
reindeer; always drives dogs. But on a long
journey, a great marathon race, reindeer would
win, I do believe they would. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was suddenly startled from her reflections
by the appearance of a brown-hooded head not
twenty rods away. Their course had led them
closer to Scarberry&rsquo;s camp than she thought.
As she came out upon the ridge she saw an
Eskimo scout disappearing into the willows from
which a camp smoke was rising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Marian was greatly disturbed by the thought
that Scarberry&rsquo;s camp would soon know of her
departure. She had hoped that they might not
learn of her errand, that they might not miss
her from the camp. For Patsy&rsquo;s sake she was
tempted to turn back, but after a moment&rsquo;s
indecision, she determined to push forward.
There was no other way to win, and win she
must!</p>
<p>An hour later she halted the deer at a fork
in the trail. Directly before her stood a bold
range of mountains, and their peaks seemed to
be smoking with drifting snow. Blizzards were
there, the perpetual blizzards of Arctic peaks.
She had never crossed those mountains, perhaps
no person ever had. She had intended skirting
them to the north. This would require at least
one added day of travel. As she thought of the
perils that awaited Patsy while alone with the
herd, and as she thought of the great necessity
of making every hour count, she was tempted to
try the mountain pass. Here was a time for
decision; when all might be gained by a bold
stroke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Rising suddenly on tip-toe, as if thus to
emphasize a great resolve, she pointed away to
the mountains and said with all the dignity of
a Jean d&rsquo;Arc:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak, we go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wide-eyed with amazement, Attatak stared at
Marian for a full minute; then with the cheerful
smile of a born explorer&mdash;which any member
of her race always is&mdash;she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na-goo-va-ruk-tuck.</i>&rdquo; (That will be very
good.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />THE ENCHANTED MOUNTAIN</h2>
<p>Since the time she had been able to remember
anything, these mountains of the far north,
standing away in bleak triangles of lights and
shadows, smoking with the eternally drifting
snows, had always held an all but irresistible
lure for Marian. Even as a child of six, listening
to the weird folk-stories of the Eskimo, she
had peopled those treeless, wind swept mountains
with all manner of strange folks. Now
they were fairies, white and drifting as the snow
itself; now they were strange black goblins with
round faces and red noses; and now an Eskimo
people who lived in enchanted caves that never
were cold, no matter how bitterly the wind and
cold assailed the fortresses of rocks that offered
them protection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All my life,&rdquo; she murmured as she tightened
the rawhide thong that served as a belt to bind
her parka close about her waist, &ldquo;I have wanted
to go to the crest of that range, and now I am to
attempt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered a little at thought of the perils
that awaited her. Many were the strange, wild
tales she had heard told round the glowing stove
at the back of her father&rsquo;s store; tales of privation,
freezing, starvation and death; tales told
by grizzled old prospectors who had lost their
pals in a bold struggle with the elements. She
thought of these stories and again she shivered,
but she did not turn back.</p>
<p>Once only, after an hour of travel up steep
ravines and steeper foothills, she paused to
unstrap her field glasses and look back over
the way they had come. Then she threw back
her head and laughed. It was the wild, free
laugh of a daring soul that defies failure.</p>
<p>Attatak showed all her splendid white teeth
in a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is afraid?&rdquo; Marian laughed. &ldquo;Snow,
cold, wind&mdash;who cares?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Marian spoke to her reindeer, and again they
were away.</p>
<p>As they left the foothills and began to circle
one of the lesser peaks&mdash;a slow, gradually
rising spiral circle that brought them higher
and higher&mdash;Marian felt the old charm of the
mountains come back to her. Again they were
peopled by strange fairies and goblins. So real
was the illusion that at times it seemed to her
that if worst came to worst and they found
themselves lost in a storm at the mountain top,
they might call upon these phantom people for
shelter.</p>
<p>The mountain was not exactly as she had
expected to find it. She had supposed that it
was one vast cone of gleaming snow. In the
main this was true, yet here and there some
rocky promontory, towering higher than its
fellows, reared itself above the surface, a pier
of granite standing out black against the whiteness
about it, mute monument to all those daring
climbers who have lost their lives on mountain
peaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Once, too, off some distance to her right and
farther up, she fancied she saw the yawning
mouth of a cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; she told herself.
And yet, it did seem so real that she found herself
expecting some strange Rip Van Winkle-like
people to come swarming out of the cavern.</p>
<p>She shook herself as a rude blast of wind
swept up from below, all but freezing her cheek
at a single wild whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must stop dreaming,&rdquo; she told herself
stoutly. &ldquo;Night is falling. We are on the
mountain, nearing the crest. A storm is rising.
It is colder here than in any place I have ever
been. Perhaps we have been foolhardy, but now
we must go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she thought this through, Attatak
pointed to her cheek and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Froze-tuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cheek frozen!&rdquo; Marian cried in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>&rdquo; (yes.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we have an hour&rsquo;s climb to reach the
top. Perhaps more. Somehow we must have
shelter. Attatak, can you build a snow house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very good. Not build them any more,
my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then,&rdquo; said Marian slowly, as she
rubbed snow on the white, frozen spots of her
cheek, &ldquo;then we must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five times in the next twenty minutes Attatak
told her her cheeks were frozen. Twice Attatak
had been obliged to rub the frost from her own
cheeks. Each time the intervals between freezings
were shorter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak,&rdquo; Marian asked, &ldquo;can we make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Canok-ti-ma-na</i>&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know.) The Eskimo
girl&rsquo;s face was very grave.</p>
<p>As Marian turned about she realized that the
storm from below was increasing. Snow, stopping
nowhere, raced past them to go smoking
out over the mountain peak.</p>
<p>She was about to start forward when again
she caught sight of a dark spot on the mountain
side above. It looked like the mouth of a cavern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only it were,&rdquo; she said wistfully, &ldquo;we
would camp there for the night and wait for
the worst of the storm to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;you wait here.
I am going to try to climb up there.&rdquo; She
pointed to the dark spot on the hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Attatak. &ldquo;Be careful. Foot
slip, start to slide; never stop.&rdquo; She looked
first up the hill, then down the dizzy white slope
that extended for a half mile to unknown depths
below.</p>
<p>As Marian&rsquo;s gaze followed Attatak&rsquo;s she saw
herself gliding down the slope, gaining speed,
shooting down faster and faster to some awful,
unknown end; a dash against a projecting rock;
a burial beneath a hundred feet of snow. Little
wonder that her knees trembled as she turned
to go. Yet she did not falter.</p>
<p>With a cheerful &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo;
she gripped her staff and began to climb.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />TROUBLE FOR PATSY</h2>
<p>Hardly had Marian left camp when troubles
began to pile up for Patsy. Dawn had not yet
come when she heard a strange ki-yi-ing that
certainly did not come from the herd collies,
and she looked out and saw approaching the
most disreputable group of Eskimos she had
ever seen. Dressed in ragged parkas of rabbit
skins, and driving the gauntest, most vicious
looking pack of wolf dogs, these people appeared
to come from a new and more savage world
than hers. A rapid count told her there were
seven adults and five children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of them to eat us out of everything,
even to skin boots and rawhide harness,&rdquo; she
groaned. &ldquo;If they are determined to camp
here, who&rsquo;s to prevent them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>For a moment she stood there staring; then
with a sudden resolve that she must meet the
situation, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must send them on. Some way, I must.
I can&rsquo;t let them starve. They must have food,
but they must be sent on to some spot where
they have relatives who are able to feed them.
The safety of the herd depends upon that. With
food gone we cannot hold our herders. With no
herders we cannot hold the deer. Marian
explained that to me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking with all the dignity her sixteen years
would permit, she approached the spot where the
strangers had halted their dogs and were talking
to old Terogloona. The dogs were acting
strangely. Sawing at the strong rawhide bonds
that held them to the sleds, they reared up on
their haunches, ki-yi-ing for all they were worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They smell our deer,&rdquo; Patsy said to herself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing our herd is at the
upper end of the range!&rdquo; She remembered
hearing Marian tell how a whole herd of five
thousand deer had been hopelessly stampeded
by the lusty ki-yi-ing of one wolf dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The reindeer is their natural food,&rdquo; Marian
had explained. &ldquo;If even one of them gets loose
when there is a reindeer about he will rush
straight at him and leap for his throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one more reason why I must get
these people to move on at once,&rdquo; Patsy whispered
to herself.</p>
<p>To Terogloona she said: &ldquo;What do they
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terogloona turned to them with a simple:
&ldquo;<i>Suna-go-pezuk-peet?</i>&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;What do
you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many guttural expressions and much
waving of hands, the leader explained their
wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say,&rdquo; smiled Terogloona, &ldquo;that in the
hills about here are many foxes, black fox,
red fox, white, blue and cross fox. He say,
that one, want to camp here; want to set traps;
want to catch foxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will they eat?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>Terogloona, having interpreted the question,
smiled again at their answer:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They will eat foxes,&rdquo; he answered quietly
and modestly.</p>
<p>For a moment Patsy looked into their staring,
hungry, questioning eyes. They were lying,
and she knew it, but remembering a bit of advice
of her father&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Never quarrel with a
hungry person&mdash;feed him,&rdquo; she smiled as she
said to Terogloona:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell them that this morning they shall
eat breakfast with me; that we will have pancakes
and reindeer steak, and tea with plenty
of sugar in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Capseta! Ali-ne-ca! Capseta!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed
one of the strangers who had understood the
word sugar and was passing it on in the native
word, <i>Capseta</i>, to his companions.</p>
<p>It was a busy morning for Patsy. There
seemed no end to the appetites of these half
starved natives. Even Terogloona grumbled at
the amount they ate, but Patsy silenced him
with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First they must be fed, then we will talk
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Troubles seldom come singly. Hardly had
the last pancake been devoured, than Terogloona,
looking up from his labors, uttered an exclamation
of surprise. A half mile up from the camp
the tundra was brown with feeding reindeer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarberry&rsquo;s herd,&rdquo; he hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy. &ldquo;They dare to do
that? They dare to drive their deer on our
nearest and best pasture? And what can we do
to stop them? Must Marian&rsquo;s mission be in
vain? Must she go all that way for nothing?
If they remain, the range will be stripped long
before she can return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressing her hands to her temples, she sat
down unsteadily upon one of the sleds of the
strangers.</p>
<p>She was struggling in a wild endeavor to
think of some way out. Then, of a sudden, a
wolfdog jumped up at her very feet and began
to ki-yi in a most distressing fashion.</p>
<p>Looking up, she saw that three of Scarberry&rsquo;s
deer, having strayed nearer the camp than the
others, had attracted the dog&rsquo;s attention. Like
a flash, a possible solution to her problem popped
into Patsy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>With a cry of delight she sprang to her feet.
The next instant she was her usual, calm self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terogloona,&rdquo; she said steadily, &ldquo;come into
the tent for a moment. I have something I
wish to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The task which Marian had set for herself,
the scaling of the mountain to the dark spot
in its side, was no easy one. Packed by the
beating blast of a thousand gales, the snow
was like white flint. It rang like steel to the
touch of her iron shod staff. It was impossible
to make an impression in its surface with the
soft heel of her deerskin boots. The only way
she could make progress was by the aid of
her staff. One slip of that staff, one false step,
and she would go gliding, faster, faster, ever
faster, to a terrible death far below.</p>
<p>Yet to falter now meant that death of another
sort waited her; death in the form of increasing
cold and gathering storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Yet she made progress in spite of the cold
that numbed her hands and feet; in spite of
her wildly beating heart; regardless of the
terror that gripped her. Now she had covered
half the distance; now two-thirds; now she
could be scarcely a hundred yards away. And
now she saw clearly. She had not been mistaken.
That black spot in the wall of snow
was a yawning hole in the side of the mountain,
a refuge in the time of storm. Could she
but reach it, all would be well.</p>
<p>Could she do it? From her position the way
up appeared steeper. She thought of going
back for the reindeer. Their knife-like hoofs,
cutting into the flinty snow, would carry them
safely upward. She now regretted that she had
not driven one before her. Vain regret. To
descend now was more perilous than to go
forward.</p>
<p>So, gripping her staff firmly, pressing her
breast to still the wild beating of her heart, and
setting her eyes upon the goal lest they stray
to the depths below, she again began to climb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Now she began going first to right, then to
left. This zig-zag course, though longer, was
less steep. Up&mdash;up&mdash;up she struggled, until
at last, with an exultant cry of joy, she threw
herself over a broad parapet of snow and the
next instant found herself looking down at a
world which but the moment before had appeared
to be reaching up white menacing hands
at her. Then she turned to peer into the dark
depths of the cave. She shivered as she looked.
Her old fancies of fairies and goblins, of strange,
wild people inhabiting these mountains, came
sweeping back and quite unnerved her.</p>
<p>The next moment she was herself again, and
turning she called down to Attatak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-hoo! Who-hoo! Bring the reindeer
up. Here is shelter for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inaudible answer came floating back to
her. Then she saw the reindeer turn about and
begin the long, zig-zag course that in time
would bring them to the mouth of the newly
discovered cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Marian said softly to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>She was no longer afraid of the dark shadows
behind her. In the place of fear had come a
great curiosity. The same questions which have
come to all people throughout all time upon discovering
a strange cave in the mountains, had
come to her. &ldquo;Am I,&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;the
first person whose footsteps have echoed in those
mysterious corridors of nature, or have there
been others? If there have been others, who
were they? What were they like? What did
they leave behind that will tell the story of their
visit here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian tried to shake herself free from these
questions. It was extremely unlikely that any
one, in all the hurrying centuries, had ever
passed this way. They were on the side of a
mountain. She had never known of a person
crossing the range before. So she reasoned, but
in the end found herself hoping that this cave
might yield to her adventure loving soul some
new and hitherto inexperienced thrill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>In the meantime she heard the labored breathing
of the reindeer as they toiled up the mountainside.
They would soon be here. Then she
and Attatak would make camp, and safe from
the cold and storm, they would sleep in peace.</p>
<p>A great wave of thankfulness swept over her,
and with the fervent reverence of a child, she
lifted her eyes to the stars and uttered a prayer
of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>When the wave of emotion had passed, curiosity
again gripped her. She wished to enter
the cave, yet shrank from it. Like a child
afraid of the dark, she feared to go forward
alone. So, drawing her parka hood close
about her face to protect it from the cold, she
waited for Attatak&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>Even as she waited there crept into her mind
a disturbing question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;I do wonder
how Patsy is getting along with the herd?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />PATSY SOLVES A PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Turning from the group of strange natives,
Patsy lead Terogloona into the igloo and drawing
his grandfatherly head down close to hers,
she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terogloona, are reindeer much afraid of
native wolf dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh!</i>&rdquo; Terogloona nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, very, very much afraid of them?&rdquo;
Patsy insisted.</p>
<p>Terogloona&rsquo;s head nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Patsy, with a twinkle in her
eye, &ldquo;if we let one wolfdog loose, and he went
toward Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s herd, would they run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh.</i> Mebby. Want kill reindeer, that
dog. Mebby kill one, two, three&mdash;many.
Sometimes that way, wolfdogs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Terogloona&rsquo;s horror of the thing she had proposed,
shone in his eyes. Many years he had
been a herder of reindeer. Many a dog had
he killed to save a reindeer. His love for dogs
was strong. His love for reindeer was stronger.
To deliberately turn a wolfdog loose to prey
upon a herd of reindeer, even an enemy&rsquo;s herd,
was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Patsy, having read his thoughts, threw back
her head and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said soberly, &ldquo;but,
Terogloona, if each one of those strange Eskimo
people should take a dog by his draw rope, and
then they all should walk toward that old cheat&rsquo;s
herd, what would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden gleam stole into the aged herder&rsquo;s
eyes. He was beginning to catch her meaning.
The deer were upon forbidden ground. She
was finding a way to drive them back to the
place where they belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would go away very fast,&rdquo; he said
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And would these Eskimos do that; would
they do it for two sacks of flour; two cans of
baking-powder; two slabs of bacon and some
sugar?&rdquo; asked Patsy breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Terogloona, staring at
her, &ldquo;they would do anything; anything you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go tell them they shall have it,&rdquo; said Patsy.
&ldquo;Tell them they must drive Scarberry&rsquo;s herd
back to the Come-saw River valley where they
belong, and that they may take their flour, sugar
and other things along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Eskimos crowded about Terogloona, listened
to him in silence until he had finished, then
burst into a chorus of &ldquo;<i>Eh-eh! Ke! Ke Kullemuk,
Ke-Ke</i>,&rdquo; which Patsy rightfully interpreted
as meaning that they were ready for the enterprise
and that Terogloona was to bring on
the reward.</p>
<p>It was a strange line of march that formed
soon after. Seven Eskimos, each holding to a
strap, at the other end of which a native dog
reared and ki-yi&rsquo;ed, spread out in a broad line,
and followed by a sled drawn by the four remaining
dogs, they started toward Scarberry&rsquo;s
herd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>As they came closer to the herd, the leaders
of the antlered throng tossed their heads and
whistled. As they came still closer there sounded
the rattle of antler upon antler as the herd
backed in upon itself.</p>
<p>The solitary herder, who had been left to
watch the herd, looked at the on-coming members
of his own race and then shouted at them
angrily.</p>
<p>The Eskimos with the dogs marched straight
ahead, appearing not to hear the shouts of
the angry herder. In less time than it takes to
tell it the herd was in full stampede. In vain
were the shouts of Scarberry&rsquo;s herders. In
vain their herd dogs sought to stem the flight.
The reindeer had scented their ancient foe; they
had heard his loud ki-yi. They were headed
for their home range, and would not pause
until they had reached it. Marian&rsquo;s hills and
tundra were not for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>As for Scarberry&rsquo;s herders, they might remain
where they were or follow. They chose
to follow. An hour later, with a sigh of satisfaction,
Patsy saw them driving their sled deer
over the broad trail of the herd that had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they come back?&rdquo; she asked Terogloona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby yes; mebby no,&rdquo; said Terogloona.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he was silent; then with a
queer look on his face he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I am much afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby not come,&rdquo; said Terogloona, looking
as if he was sorry he had spoken.</p>
<p>That was all he would say and Patsy felt a
bit uneasy over his remark. Nevertheless, she
could not help having a feeling of pride in her
first day&rsquo;s work as manager of the herd. Two
serious problems had arisen and she had matched
them against each other with the result that
both had vanished. She had succeeded in getting
rid of the unwelcome visitors and Bill
Scarberry&rsquo;s great herd. She had a right to feel
a bit proud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;10 - 10 = 0,&rdquo; she marked on the floor with
a bit of charcoal. &ldquo;We are minus a few eatables
but we can spare them all right. Besides,
it&rsquo;s real satisfying to know that you&rsquo;ve given
several hungry people an opportunity to earn
a week&rsquo;s provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she known the full and final effect of
that week&rsquo;s provisions, she might have experienced
some moments of uncomfortable thinking.
Lacking that knowledge, she smiled as
she busied herself with preparing a belated
breakfast for Terogloona and herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>To Attatak, whose mind was filled with the
weird tales of the spirit world, to enter a cave
away on this unknown mountain side was a far
greater trial than it was to Marian. Cold,
blizzards, the wild beasts of timberlands&mdash;these
she could face; but the possible dwelling place
of the spirits of dead polar bears and walruses,
to say nothing of old women who had died
because they had disregarded the incantations
of witch doctors, &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;&mdash;this was very bad
indeed.</p>
<p>Marian felt the native girl tremble as she
took her arm and led her gently forward into
the dark depths of the cave.</p>
<p>The entrance was not wide, perhaps twelve
feet across, but it was fully as high as it was
broad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our deer can come in, too,&rdquo; whispered
Marian, &ldquo;if it goes back far enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are no wolves,&rdquo; said Attatak with
a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves?&rdquo; Marian had not thought of that.
&ldquo;You wait here,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for
the rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Attatak gripped her arm until
it hurt. &ldquo;I will go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So back out of the cave they felt their way,
now tripping over rocks that rolled away with
a hollow sound like distant thunder, now brushing
the wall, till they came at last to the open air.</p>
<p>Marian hated all this delay. Famished with
hunger, chilled to the very marrow, and weary
enough to drop, she longed for the warmth of
the fire she hoped they might light, for the food
they would warm over it, and the comforting
rest that would follow. Yet she realized that
the utmost caution must be taken. Wolves, once
driven from a cave, might stampede their reindeer
and lose them forever in the mountains.
Without reindeer they should have great trouble
in getting back to camp; the Agent would go
on his way ignorant of their dilemma; their
pasture land would be lost, and perhaps their
herd with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>The rifle securely gripped in the hands of
Attatak, who was the surer shot of the two,
they again started into the cave. Strange to
say, once the rifle was in her grasp, Attatak
became the bravest of the brave.</p>
<p>Marian carried a candle in one hand, and in
the other a block of safety matches. The candle
was not lighted. So drafty was the entrance
that no candle would stay lighted. Each step
she hoped would bring them to a place where
the draft would not extinguish her candle. But
in this she was disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a windy cavern,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Must be
an entrance at each end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling on Attatak to pause, Marian struck a
match. It flared up, then went out. A second
one did the same. The third lighted the candle.
There was just time for a hasty glance about.
Gloomy brown walls lay to right and left of
them, and the awful gloom of the cave was
most alarming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Glancing down at her feet, Marian uttered a
low exclamation of surprise. Then, with such a
definite and direct puff of wind as might come
from human lips, the candle was snuffed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what was it?&rdquo; Attatak whispered.
She was shaking so that Marian feared she
would let the rifle go clattering to the rocky floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Marian answered. &ldquo;Really nothing
at all. The ashes of a camp-fire, and I
thought&mdash;thought,&rdquo; she gulped, &ldquo;thought I saw
bones in the ashes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bones?&rdquo; This time the rifle did clatter to
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak,&rdquo; Marian scolded; &ldquo;Attatak. This is
absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groping in the dark for the rifle, she grasped
a handful of ashes, then something hard and
cold that was not the rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she groaned, struggling with all her
might to keep from running away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Again she tried for the rifle, this time successfully.
She gave it to Attatak, with the admonition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca-ca!</i>&rdquo; (Do take care!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; Attatak whispered.</p>
<p>Stepping gingerly out of the ashes of the mysterious
camp-fire, they again started forward.</p>
<p>The current of air now became less and less
strong, and finally when Marian again tried the
candle it burned with a flickering blaze.</p>
<p>A glance about told them they were now
between narrow dark walls, that the ceiling was
very high, and there was nothing beneath their
feet but rock.</p>
<p>The yellow glow of light cheered them. If
there were wolves they had made no sound; the
gleam of their eyes had not been seen. If the
spirits of the men who had built that long extinguished
fire still haunted the place, the light
would drive them away. Attatak assured Marian
of that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>With one candle securely set in a rocky recess,
and with another close at hand, Attatak was
even willing to remain in the cave while Marian
brought the reindeer in a little way and carried
the articles necessary for a meal to the back
of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no moss on this barren mountain,&rdquo;
Marian sighed. &ldquo;Our reindeer must go hungry
to-night, but once we are off the mountain they
shall have a grand feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had made a small fire on the
floor of the cave and had finished their supper,
night had closed in upon their mountain world.
Darkness came quickly, deepened tenfold by the
wild storm that appeared to redouble its fury at
every fresh blast. The darkness without vied
with the bleakness of the cave until both were
one. Such a storm as it was! Born and reared
on the coast of Alaska, Marian had never before
experienced anything that approached it in its
shrieking violence. She did not wonder now
that the mountains appeared to smoke with
sweeping snow. She shivered as she thought
what it would have meant had they not found
the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said to Attatak, &ldquo;we should have
been caught up by the wind like two bits of snow
and hurled over the mountain peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls walked to the mouth of the
cave and for a moment stood peering into the
night. The whistle and howl of the wind was
deafening. &ldquo;Whew&mdash;whoo&mdash;whoo&mdash;whe-w&mdash;w-o&mdash;,&rdquo;
how it did howl! The very rock
ribbed mountain seemed to shake from the violence
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eleet-pon-a-muck</i>,&rdquo; (too bad), said Attatak
as she turned her back to the storm.</p>
<p>For Marian, however, the spectacle held a
strange fascination. Had the thing been possible,
she should have liked nothing better than
leaping out into it. To battle with it; to answer
its roar with a wild scream of her own; to whirl
away with it; to become a part of it; to revel
in its madness&mdash;this, it seemed to her, would
be the height of ecstatic joy. Such was the call
of unbridled nature to her joyous, triumphant
youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>It was with reluctance that she at last turned
back into the depths of the cave and helped
Attatak unroll the bedding roll and prepare for
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she whispered to Attatak before
she closed her eyes in sleep, &ldquo;if the storm
has not passed, and we dare not venture out,
we will explore the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; Attatak answered drowsily.</p>
<p>The next moment the roaring storm had no
auditors. The girls were fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE GIRL OF THE PURPLE FLAME</h2>
<p>There is something in the sharp tang of the
Arctic air, in the honest weariness of a long day
of tramping, in the invigorating freshness of
everything about one, that makes for perfect
repose. In spite of the problems that faced
them, regardless of the mystery that haunted
this chamber of nature, hour after hour, to the
very tune of the whirling storm, the girls slept
the calm and peaceful sleep of those who bear
ill will toward no one.</p>
<p>When at last Marian pried her eyes open to
look at her watch, she was surprised to learn
that eight hours had passed. She did not look
to see the gleam of dawn at the mouth of the
cave. Dawn in this strange Arctic land was
still four hours away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>She knew that the storm was still raging.
There came the roar and boom of the wind.
Now and again, as if the demons of storm were
determined upon pulling them from their retreat,
a steady sucking breath of it came sweeping
down through the cave. Marian listened, and
then she quoted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Blow high, blow low,</p>
<p class="t2">Not all your snow</p>
<p class="t0">Can quench our hearth-fire&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t2">Ruddy glow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She smiled to herself. Their tiny fire had gone
out long ago, but another might easily be kindled.</p>
<p>She was about to turn over in her bed for
another ten winks, when she suddenly remembered
the mysterious discovery of the night
before&mdash;the ashes and the bones, and at once
she found herself eager for an exploration of
the place. To discover if possible what sort of
people had been here before her; to guess how
long ago that had been; to search for any relics
they may have left behind&mdash;all these exerted
upon her mind an irresistible appeal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>She had risen and was drawing on her knickers
when Attatak awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Marian cried, &ldquo;it is morning.
The storm is still tearing away at the mountain
side. We can&rsquo;t go on our way. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eleet-pon-a-muck!</i>&rdquo; (too bad), broke in
Attatak. &ldquo;Now Bill Scarberry will get our
pasture. The Agent will pass before we arrive.
We shall have no one to defend our herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Marian plumped down upon her sleeping
bag. What Attatak said was true. Should
they be unable to leave the cave this day, the
gain they had hoped to make was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she laughed bravely, &ldquo;we have reindeer,
and they are swift. We will win yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said, springing to her feet,
&ldquo;no use crying over spilled milk. Until we can
leave the cave our time&rsquo;s our own. Come on.
Get dressed. We&rsquo;ll see what wealth lies hidden
in this old home in the mountain side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Patsy was having a full
share of strange adventure. Late in the afternoon,
feeling herself quite free from the annoying
presence of the visiting band of Eskimos
and of Scarberry&rsquo;s herd, she harnessed her
favorite spotted reindeer and went for a drive
up the valley. The two young Eskimos who
worked under Terogloona had been sent into
the hills to round up their herd and bring them
into camp. This was one of the daily tasks of
the herders. If this was done every day the
herd would never stray too far. Patsy liked to
mount a hill with her sled deer and then, like a
general reviewing his troops, watch the broad
procession of brown and white deer as they
marched down the valley.</p>
<p>This day she was a little late. The herd began
passing before she had climbed half way up the
ridge. She paused to watch them pass. Then,
undecided whether to climb on up the slope or
turn back to camp, she stood there until the
uncertain light of the low Arctic sun had faded
and night had come. Just as she had decided
to turn her deer toward home, she caught a
purple gleam on the hill directly above her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And
not a quarter of a mile above me. I could climb
up there in fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stood undecided. Then,
seized by a sudden touch of daring, she whirled
her deer about, tethered him to his sled, and
went scouting up a gully toward the spot where
the mysterious flame had flashed for a moment,
then had gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see something, anyway,&rdquo; she told herself
as she strove in vain to still the painful fluttering
of her heart.</p>
<p>She had worked her way to a position on the
side of the hill where the outlines of a tent, with
its extension of stovepipe standing out black
above it, was outlined against the sky. Then, to
her consternation, she saw the flaps of the tent
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is coming out,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;Perhaps they have been watching me
through a hole in the tent. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Her heart stopped beating at thought of the
dangers that might be threatening. Should she
turn and flee, or should she flatten herself
against the snow and hope that she might not
be seen? Suddenly remembering that her parka,
made of white fawnskin, would blend perfectly
with the snow, she decided on the latter course.</p>
<p>There was not a second to lose. Hardly had
she melted into the background of snow when a
person appeared at the entrance of the tent.</p>
<p>Then it was that Patsy received a thrilling
shock. She had been prepared to see a bearded
miner, an Eskimo, most any type of man. But
the person she saw was not a man, but <i>a woman</i>;
scarcely that&mdash;little more than a girl.</p>
<p>It was with the utmost difficulty that Patsy
suppressed an audible exclamation. Closing her
lips tight, she took one startled look at the
strange girl.</p>
<p>Carefully dressed in short plaid skirt, bright
checkered mackinaw, and a blue knit hood; the
girl stood perfectly silhouetted against the sky.
Her eyes and hair were brown; Patsy was sure
of that. Her features were fine. There was a
deep shade of healthy pink in her cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a native Alaskan,&rdquo; Patsy told
herself. &ldquo;Like me, she has not been long in
Alaska.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How she knew this she could not exactly tell,
but she was as sure of it as she was of anything
in life. Suddenly she was puzzled by a question:
&ldquo;What had brought the girl from the
warmth of the tent into the cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy saw her glance up toward the sky.
There was a rapt look on her face as she gazed
fixedly at the first evening stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if she were saying a prayer or a
Psalm,&rdquo; Patsy murmured. &ldquo;&lsquo;The heavens declare
the glory of God and the firmament his
handiwork.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full moment the strange girl stood thus;
then, turning slowly, she stepped back into the
tent. That the tent had at least one other occupant,
Patsy knew at once by a shadow that
flitted across the wall as the girl entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; mused Patsy. &ldquo;Well, now, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>She was more puzzled than ever, but suddenly
remembering that she had barely escaped
being caught spying on these strangers, she rose
and went gliding down the hill.</p>
<p>When she reached her reindeer she loosed him
and turned him toward home, nor did she allow
him to pause until he stood beside her igloo.</p>
<p>Once inside her lodge, with the candle gleaming
brightly and a fire of dry willows snapping
in the sheet-iron stove, Patsy took a good long
time for thinking things through.</p>
<p>Somewhat to her surprise, she found herself
experiencing a new feeling of safety. It was
true she had not been much afraid since Marian
had left her alone with the herders, for it was
but a step from her igloo to Terogloona&rsquo;s tent.
This old herder, who treated her as if she were
his grandchild, would gladly give his life in
defending her from danger. Nevertheless, a
little feeling of fear lingered in her mind whenever
she thought of the tent of the purple flame.
As she thought of it now she realized that she
had lost that fear when she had discovered that
there was a girl living in that tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;there are bad
women in Alaska just as there are everywhere.
She might be bad, but somehow she
didn&rsquo;t look bad. She looked educated and sort
of refined and&mdash;and&mdash;she looked a bit lonely
as she stood there gazing at the stars. I wanted
to walk right up to her and say &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; just
like that, nice and chummy. Perhaps I will, too,
some day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she thoughtfully
added a moment later. Something of the old
dread of the purple flame still haunted her mind.
Then, too, there were two puzzling questions:
Why were these people here at all; and how
did they live, if not off Marian&rsquo;s deer?</p>
<p>Not many days later Patsy was to make a
startling discovery that, to all appearances, was
an answer to this last question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />ANCIENT TREASURE</h2>
<p>With a hand that trembled slightly, Marian
held the candle that was to light their way in
the exploration of the mysterious mountain
cavern. As if drawn by a magnet, she led the
way straight to the spot where but a few hours
before she had been so frightened by finding
herself standing in the burned out ashes and
bones of an old camp-fire.</p>
<p>She laughed now as she bent over to examine
the spot. There could be no question that there
had once been a camp-fire here. There were a
number of bones strewn about, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fire,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;must have
burned itself out years ago; perhaps fifty years.
Those bones are from the legs of a reindeer or
caribou. They&rsquo;re old, too. How gray and dry
they are! They are about to fall into dust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>She studied the spot for some time. At last
she straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much to it, after all,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
interesting enough to know that some storm
blown traveler who attempted the pass, as we did,
once spent the night here. But he left no relic
of interest behind, unless&mdash;why&mdash;what have
you there?&rdquo; She turned suddenly to her
companion.</p>
<p>Attatak was holding a slim, dull brown object
in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the broken handle of an old cow-drill,&rdquo;
she said slowly, still studying the thing by the
candle light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ivory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby twenty, mebby fifty years. Who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at it so sharply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; smiled Attatak, as she placed the bit
of ivory in Marian&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;long ago, before
the white man came, my people told stories by
drawing little pictures on ivory. They scratched
the pictures on the ivory, then rubbed smoke
black in them so they would see them well. This
cow-drill handle is square. It has four sides.
Each side tells a story. Three are of hunting&mdash;walrus,
polar bear and caribou. But the other
side is something else. I can&rsquo;t quite tell what it
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian studied it for a time in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cole would love that,&rdquo; she said at last,
and her thoughts were far away. For the
moment her mind had carried her back to those
thrilling days aboard the pleasure yacht, <i>The
O&rsquo;Moo</i>. Since you have doubtless read our
other book, &ldquo;The Cruise of <i>The O&rsquo;Moo</i>,&rdquo; I
need scarcely remind you that Mr. Cole was the
curator of a great museum, and knew all about
strange and ancient things. He had done much
to aid Marian and her friends in unravelling
the mystery of the strange blue face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it along,&rdquo; Marian said, handing the
piece back to Attatak. &ldquo;It tells us one thing&mdash;that
the man who built that fire was an Eskimo.
It is worth keeping. I should like to take it
with me to the Museum when I go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said briskly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go all over
the cave. There may be things that we have
not yet discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed there were. It was with the
delicious sensation of research and adventure
that the girls wandered back and forth from
wall to wall of the gloomy cavern.</p>
<p>Not until they had passed the spot where
they had spent the night, and were far back
in the cave, did they make a discovery of any
importance. Then it was that Marian, with a
little cry of joy, put out her hand and took from
a ledge of rock a strange looking little dish no
larger than a finger bowl. It was so incrusted
with dirt and dust that she could not tell whether
it was really a rare find of some ancient pottery,
or an ordinary china dish left here by some
white adventurer. However, something within
her seemed to whisper: &ldquo;Here is wealth untold;
here is a prize that will cause your friend, the
museum curator, to turn green with envy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sulee!</i>&rdquo; (another), said Attatak, as she took
down a larger object of the same general shape.</p>
<p>A few feet farther on was a ledge fairly
covered with curious objects; strange shaped
dishes; bits of ivory, black as coal; pieces of copper,
dulled with age. Such were the treasures
of the past that lay before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s pantry of long ago,&rdquo; mused
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, very old,&rdquo; said Attatak, holding up a
bit of black ivory. &ldquo;Mebby two hundred, mebby
five hundred years. Ivory turn black slow; very,
very slow. By and by, after long, long time, look
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Attatak uttered these words Marian could
have hugged her for sheer joy. She knew now
that they had made a very rare find. The objects
had not been left there by a white man, but
by some native. Broken bits of ancient Eskimo
pottery had been found in mounds on the Arctic
coast. Those had been treasured. But here
were perfect specimens, such as any museum in
the world would covet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>And yet, had she but known it, the rareness
and value of some of these were to exceed her
fondest dreams. But this discovery was to come
later.</p>
<p>Drawing off her calico parka, Marian tied it
at the top, and using it as a sack, carefully
packed all the articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back,&rdquo; she said in an awed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; Attatak answered.</p>
<p>There was a strange spookiness about the
place that made them half afraid to remain any
longer.</p>
<p>They had turned to go, when Marian, chancing
to glance down, saw the bit of ivory they had
found by the outer camp-fire. At first she was
tempted to let it remain where it lay. It seemed
an insignificant thing after the discovery of these
rarer treasures. But finally she picked it up
and thrust it into her bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Well for her that she did. Later it was to
prove the key to a mystery, an entirely new
mystery which had as yet not appeared above
their horizon, but was, in a way, associated with
the mystery of the purple flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Marian, as they came nearer
to the mouth of the cave, &ldquo;I do believe the storm
is passing. Perhaps we can get off the mountain
to-day. Oh, Attatak! We&rsquo;ll win yet!
Won&rsquo;t that be glorious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true; the storm was passing. Attatak
was dispatched to investigate, and soon came
hurrying back with the report that they could
be on their way as soon as they had eaten breakfast
and packed.</p>
<p>Marian was possessed with a wild desire to
inspect her newly discovered treasure&mdash;to wash,
scrub and scrape it and try to discover how it
was made and what it was made of. Yet she
realized that any delay for such a cause would
be all but criminal folly. So, after a hasty
breakfast, she rubbed as much dust as she could
from the strange treasures and packed them
carefully in the folds of the sleeping bags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Soon the girls found themselves beside their
deer, picking their way cautiously forward over
the remaining distance to the divide; then quite
as cautiously they started down the other side.</p>
<p>During the day they halted for a cold
lunch while their reindeer fed on a broad plateau,
a protected place where they were safe from
the wild blizzards of the peaks that loomed far
above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on,&rdquo; said Marian, &ldquo;there will be
little rest for us. Our bold stroke has saved us
nothing. It is now a question of whether reindeer
are trustworthy steeds in the Arctic; also
whether girls are capable of solving problems,
and of enduring many hardships. As for me,&rdquo;
she shook her fist in the general direction of
Scarberry&rsquo;s herd, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say they are. We&rsquo;ll win!
See if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this declaration Attatak uttered an &ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo;
which to Marian sounded like a fervent
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />THE LONG TRAIL</h2>
<p>At nightfall of the following day, worn from
the constant travel, and walking as if in their
sleep, the two girls came to the junction of the
two forks of a modest sized river. The frozen
stream, coated as it was by a hard crust of snow,
had given them a perfect trail over the last
ten miles of travel. Before that they had crossed
endless tiers of low-lying hills whose hard packed
and treacherously slippery sides had brought grief
to them and to their reindeer. Twice an overturned
sled had dragged a reindeer off his feet,
and reindeer, sled and driver had gone rolling
and tumbling down the hill to be piled in a heap
in the gully below.</p>
<p>Those had been trying hours; but now they
were looking forward to many miles of smooth
going between the banks of this river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>First, however, there must be rest and food
for them and for their deer. They were watching
the shelving bank for some likely place to
camp, where there was shelter from the biting
wind and driftwood lodged along the bank for
a fire. Then, with a little cry of surprise,
Marian pointed at a bend in the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the river runs
southwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attatak looked straight down the river and at
the low sweeping banks beyond, then uttered a
low: &ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that we cannot follow the river,&rdquo;
said Marian. &ldquo;Our course runs northwest.
Every mile travelled on the river takes us off our
course and lessens our chance of reaching our
goal in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Attatak, in perplexity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;There is time
enough to decide. We must camp here. The
deer must have food and rest. So must we.
There is not much danger of wolves. If any
come prowling around, the deer will let us know
soon enough. We will sleep on our sleds and
if anything goes wrong, the deer, tethered to the
sleds, will tumble us out of our beds. Anyway,
they will waken us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon supper was over. The deer, having
had their fill of moss dug from beneath the snow,
had lain down to rest. The girls spread their
sleeping bags out upon the sleds and prepared
for a few hours of much needed rest. Attatak,
with the carefree unconcern that is characteristic
of her race, had scarcely buried her face in an
improvised pillow when she was fast asleep.</p>
<p>Sleep did not come so quickly to Marian.
Many matters of interest lingered in her mind.
It was as if her mind were a room all littered up
with the odds and ends of a day&rsquo;s work. She
must put it to rights before she could sleep.</p>
<p>She thought once more of the strange treasures
they had brought from the cave. Tired
as she was, she was tempted to get out those
articles and look at them, and to brush them
up a bit and see what they were like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s foolish,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s exactly as if I had hung up my stocking on
Christmas Eve, and then when Christmas morning
came, had been obliged to seize my stocking
without so much as a glance inside, and forced
to start at once on a long journey which would
offer me no opportunity to examine my stocking
until the journey was at an end. But I won&rsquo;t
look; not now. It&rsquo;s too cold. Brr-r,&rdquo; she shivered.</p>
<p>As she drew herself farther down into the
furry depths of her sleeping bag, she was reminded
of the time she and Patsy had slept together
beneath the stars. She could not help
wishing that Patsy was with her now, sharing
her sleeping bag, and looking up at the gleaming
Milky Way.</p>
<p>She wondered vaguely how Patsy was getting
on with the herd, but the thought did not greatly
disturb her. She was about to drift off to the
land of dreams, when a thought popped into her
mind that brought her up wide awake again.
Their morning&rsquo;s course was not yet laid. What
should it be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>She closed her eyes and tried to think. Then,
like a flash, it came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hard way,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Seems as if it were always the hard way
that is safe and sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought that had come to her was this:
In order to reach their destination, they must
still travel several miles north. The river they
were following flowed southwest. To go south
was to go out of their way. Were they to strike
due north, across country, they might in the
course of a day&rsquo;s travel come to another stream
which did not angle toward the south. That
would mean infinitely hard travel over snow
that was soft and yielding, and across tundra
whose frozen caribou bogs were as rough as a
cordwood road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the long, hard way,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;but we
may win. If we follow this river we never can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with all her problems put in order, she
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />MYSTERIOUS MUSIC</h2>
<p>Two days later Marian and Attatak found
themselves tramping slowly along behind their
tired deer. It was night. Now and again the
moon shot a golden beam of light across their
trail. For the most part that trail was dark,
overshadowed by great spruce and fir trees that
stood out black against the whiteness of the
snow, each tree seeming a gown clad monk&mdash;silent
witnesses of their passing.</p>
<p>There was now a definitely marked trail. An
ax cut here and there on a tree told them this
trail had been made by men, and not by moose
and caribou. They had seen no traces of man.
No human habitation had sent its gleam of light
across their trail to bid them welcome. Scarcely
knowing whether she wished to see the light of
a cabin, Marian tramped doggedly on. It was
long past camping time, yet she feared to make
camp. Several times she had caught the long
drawn howl of a wolf, faint and indistinct in
the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>With a burst of joy and hope she thought of
the progress they had made. The tramp across
open tundra had been fearfully hard. They had,
however, reaped from it a rich reward; the river
they had found was larger than the other and its
surface had offered an almost perfect trail. It
flowed north by west instead of southwest. It
took them directly on their way. Even now
Marian was wondering if this were not the very
river at whose junction with the great Yukon
was located the station they sought to reach
before the Government Agent had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;what can hinder
us from making the station in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed that there could be but one answer
to this; yet in the Arctic there is no expression
that is so invariably true as this one: &ldquo;You never
can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Then, suddenly, Marian&rsquo;s thoughts were
drawn to another subject. A peculiar gleam of
moonlight among the trees reminded her of the
purple flame. At once she began wondering
what could be the source of that peculiar and
powerful light; who possessed it, and what their
purpose was in living on the tundra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Patsy?&rdquo; she questioned herself, &ldquo;I
wonder if they are troubling her. Wonder if
they are really living off our deer. I wish I had
not been obliged to leave our camp. Seems that
there were problems enough without this. I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she put out one hand and stopped her
deer, while with the other she gave Attatak a
mute signal for silence.</p>
<p>Breaking gently through the hushed stillness
of the forest, like a spring zephyr over a
meadow, there came to her ears a sound of
wonderful sweetness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;and such music!
The very music of Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Moments passed, and still with slightly bowed
heads, as if listening to the Angelus, they stood
there, still as statues, listening to the strange
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods were God&rsquo;s first temples,&rdquo; Marian
whispered.</p>
<p>For the moment she lived as in a trance. A
great lover of music, she felt the thrill of perfect
melody breaking over her soul like bright
waves upon golden sand. She fancied that this
melody had no human origin, that it was a spontaneous
outburst from the very heart of the
forest; God himself speaking through the mute
life of earth.</p>
<p>When this illusion had passed she still stood
there wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attatak, what day of the week is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Attatak did not answer. She
was counting on her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday,&rdquo; Marian repeated. &ldquo;And that is
a pipe organ. How wonderful! How perfectly
beautiful! A pipe organ in the midst of the
forest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she hesitated, scarcely daring to
believe her senses, &ldquo;how could a pipe organ be
brought way up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is!&rdquo; she affirmed a few seconds later.
&ldquo;Attatak, you watch the deer while I go ahead
and find out what sort of place it is, and whether
there are dangerous dogs about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her wonder grew with every step that she
took in the direction of the mysterious musician.
As she came closer, and the tones became more
distinct, she knew that she could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pipe organ,&rdquo; she told herself with conviction,
&ldquo;and a splendid one at that! Who in
all the world would bring such a wonderful instrument
away up here? Strange I have never
heard of this settlement. It must be a rather
large village or they could not afford such an
organ for their church.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>As she thought of these things, and as the
rise and fall of the music still came sweeping
through the trees, a strange spell fell upon her.
It was as if she were resting upon the soft,
cushioned seat of some splendid church. With
the service appealing to her sense of the artistic
and the beautiful, and to her instinct of reverence;
with the soft lights pervading all, she was
again in the chapel of her own university.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I do hope it&rsquo;s a real church
and that we&rsquo;re not too late for the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thought troubled her as she hurried forward.
If this was a large village, where were
the tracks of dog teams that must surely be
travelling up the river; trappers going out over
their lines of traps; hunters seeking caribou;
prospectors starting away over the trail for a
fresh search for the ever illusive yellow gold?
Surely all these would have left a well beaten
trail. Yet since the last snow there had not
been a single team passing that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a village of the dead,&rdquo; she mused,
and shivered at the thought.</p>
<p>When at last she rounded a turn and came
within full sight of the place from which the
enchanting tones issued, the sight that met her
eyes caused her to start back and stare with
surprise and amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>She had expected to find a cluster of log
cabins; a store, a church and a school. Instead,
she saw a yawning hole in a bank of snow; a
hole that was doubtless an entrance to some sort
of structure. Whether the structure was built
of sod, logs, or merely of snow, she could not
guess. Some thirty feet from this entrance, and
higher, apparently perched on the crust of snow,
were two such cupola affairs as Marian had seen
on certain types of sailing vessels and gasoline
schooners. From these there streamed a pale
yellow light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, of all
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, undecided whether to flee from
that strange place, she stood stock still.</p>
<p>The organ, for the moment, was stilled. The
woods were silent. Such a hush as she had never
experienced in all her life lay over all. Then,
faint, indistinct, came a single note of music.
Someone had touched a key. The next instant
the world seemed filled with the most wonderful
melody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Handel&rsquo;s Largo</i>,&rdquo; she whispered as she stood
there enchanted. Of all pipe organ music, she
loved Handel&rsquo;s Largo best. Throughout the rendering
of the entire selection, she stood as one
enchanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; she said when the sound of
the last note had died away in the tree tops.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very mysterious, but any person who
can play <i>Handel&rsquo;s Largo</i> like that is not going
to be unkind to two girls who are far from home.
I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With unfaltering footsteps she started forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />AN OLD MAN OF THE NORTH</h2>
<p>Having walked resolutely to the black hole in
the snow bank, Marian looked within. There
was no door; merely an opening here. A dim
lamp in the distance sent an uncertain and
ghostly light down the corridor. By this light
she made out numerous posts and saw that a
narrow passage-way ran between them.</p>
<p>There was something so mysterious about the
place that she hesitated on the threshold. At
that moment a thought flashed through her
mind, a startling and disheartening thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radio,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;nothing but radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was convinced in an instant that her solution
of the origin of the wonderful music was
correct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The persons who lived in this strange dwelling,
which reminded her of pictures she had seen of
the dens and caves of robbers and brigands, had
somehow come into possession of a powerful
radio receiving set. Somewhere in Nome, or
Fairbanks, or perhaps even in Seattle&mdash;a noted
musician was giving an organ recital. This radio
set with its loud speaker had picked up the music
and had faithfully reproduced it. That was all
there was to the mystery. There was no pipe
organ, no skillful musician out here in the forest
wilderness. It had been stupid of her to think
there might be.</p>
<p>This revelation, for revelation it surely seemed
to be, was both disappointing and disturbing.
Disappointing, because in her adventure-loving
soul she had hoped to discover here in the wilderness
a thing that to all appearances could not
be&mdash;a modern miracle. Disturbing it was, too,
for since a mere instrument, a radio-phone, has
no soul, the character of the person who operated
it might be anything at all. She could not conceive
of the person who actually touched the keys
and caused that divine music to pour forth as a
villain. Any sort of person, however, might
snap on the switch that sends such music vibrating
from the horn of the loud speaker of a radiophone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>For a full five minutes she wavered between
two courses of action; to go on inside this den,
or to go back to Attatak and attempt to pass it
unobserved.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the touch of a finger on what
she supposed to be a far off key&mdash;the resuming
of the music; perhaps it was her own utter weariness
that decided her at last. Whatever it was,
she set a resolute foot inside the entrance, and
the next instant found herself carefully picking
her way down the dark passage toward the dim
lamp.</p>
<p>To her surprise, when she at last reached the
lamp that hung over a door, she found not an
oil lamp, but a small electric light bulb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will marvels never cease?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>For a second she hesitated. Should she knock?
She hated spying; yet the door stood invitingly
ajar. If the persons within did not appear to
be the sort of persons a girl might trust; if she
could see them and remain unobserved, there was
still opportunity for flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Acting upon this impulse, she peered through
the crack in the door.</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise upon seeing at the far
end of a long, high-ceilinged, heavily timbered
room, not a radio horn, but a pipe organ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;my first thought was
right. That enchanting music <i>was</i> produced on
the spot. And by such a musician!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seated with his side toward her, was the bent
figure of an old man. His long, flowing white
beard, his snowy locks, the dreamy look upon his
face as his fingers drifted back and forth across
the keys, reminded her of pictures she had seen
of ancient bards playing upon golden harps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Harp of the North that mouldering long
has hung,&rsquo;&rdquo; she recited in a low voice.</p>
<p>The fingers on the keys suddenly ceased their
drifting, the dreamy look faded from the musician&rsquo;s
face. A smile lighted his eyes as, turning
about, he spoke in a cheery voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in. I have been waiting for you. You
are welcome to an old man&rsquo;s lonely house; doubly
welcome, coming as you do in time for Sunday
vespers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strange, almost uncanny proceeding so
startled the girl that for a second she was
tempted to turn and flee. The next second she
had complete control of herself. Pushing the
door open, as if entering the chamber of the king
of fairies, she made a little bow and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, realizing how perfectly absurd her action
had been, she broke into a hearty laugh and
in this laugh the old man joined.</p>
<p>So, with the ice broken, they became friends
at once.</p>
<p>To her vast relief she found that the old man,
though he had undoubtedly been expecting them
or someone else, did not know all about them.
He asked if they travelled with dog team or reindeer.
Upon being told that they drove reindeer,
he smiled and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good. It&rsquo;s lucky I have feed for your deer.
Reindeer people seldom come this way. Once
I was caught unprepared to entertain them, so
last autumn I put in a good stock of moss and
willow leaves. Your deer shall be safely housed
and richly fed, and so shall you. Go bring them
at once. Or shall I go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; that is not necessary,&rdquo; Marian hastened
to assure him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, while you go I will put the
birds on to broil. You are doubtless very
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Marian was chattering to
Attatak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queerest place you ever saw; and the
strangest old gentleman. But really, I think he
is a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE BARRIER</h2>
<p>The curiosity of the two girls knew no bounds
as they neared the strange abode. Who was
this man? Why did he live here all by himself?
How had he brought his pipe organ to this remote
spot? Whence had come those peculiar
skylights through which the yellow light
gleamed? Whence came the power for those
electric lights? How had this strange man
known of their coming? Or had he known?
Had he been expecting someone else and had
he, as a perfect host, pretended it was Marian
he had known to be at the door? These, and
many other questions, flashed through Marian&rsquo;s
alert mind as she guided her deer over the
remaining distance and up to the entrance to
the cave-like structure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Lights flashed on here and there as they passed
inside. A long corridor, walled on either side
by hewn logs, led to a stall-like room where was
food in abundance for their reindeer, and, what
was better still, perfect protection from any night
prowler.</p>
<p>Marian was wondering what sort of meal was
being prepared for them when they were at last
led into the large room. Here, on the side opposite
the pipe organ, great logs crackled merrily
in a fireplace half as wide as the room itself.</p>
<p>After taking their fur parkas, the host motioned
them to seats beside the fire. There,
charmed by the drowsy warmth, Marian experienced
great difficulty in keeping awake.
Strange fancies floated through her mind. She
fancied she was aboard a ship at sea; the walls
about her were the walls of her state-room; the
huge beams above, the ship&rsquo;s beams; the strange
cupola affairs above, the lights to her cabin.</p>
<p>As she shook herself free from this fancy, she
realized that aside from the fireplace, the inside
of the room was very like a cabin of a high
class schooner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must all come from some vessel,&rdquo; she
reasoned. &ldquo;Even the lighting fixtures look as if
they had been taken from a ship. I wonder what
ship, and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of stories she had read of beach
combers who wrecked ships by displaying fake
shore lights on stormy nights that they might
gather the wreckage from the beach. For a
moment she fancied this bearded patriarch playing
such a role. Finding this too absurd even for
fancy, she shook herself free from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
ravenously hungry. He spoke of putting on the
birds. I wonder what he could have meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not have long to wait. A moment
later there came to her nostrils the delicious
aroma of perfectly brewed coffee. Mingled with
it were various savory odors which gave promise
of a rich meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not yet fully warmed,&rdquo; said their
host, &ldquo;so you may eat by the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>He was pushing before him a tea-wagon of
wonderful design and craftsmanship. This was
fairly creaking under its load of chinaware of
exquisite design, and silver which did not require
a second look to tell that it was sterling.
Marian barely avoided a gasp at sight of it.</p>
<p>If the service was perfect, the food was no
less so. Four ptarmigan, those wonderful &ldquo;quail
of the Arctic,&rdquo; broiled to a delicious turn, were
flanked with potatoes, gravy, peas and apple
sauce. The desert was blueberries preserved in
wild honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only idleness or indifference,&rdquo; smiled their
host as he caught their looks of appreciation,
&ldquo;can hinder one from securing appetizing foods
in any land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said as they finished, &ldquo;there
are questions you may wish to ask; information
that you may wish to impart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo; Marian began in some confusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>He interrupted her with a wave of the hand.
&ldquo;It will all keep until morning. This habit
young people have, of sitting up talking all hours
of the night because life seems too exciting for
sleep, is all wrong. You are in need of rest.
&lsquo;Everything in its good time&rsquo; is my motto. Fortunately
my guest room is warm. The fire is not
yet burned out. Last night I had the honor of
furnishing a night&rsquo;s lodging to the Agent of our
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Agent?&rdquo; Marian asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He came up here to ask me about the
lay of the land above here. I think,&rdquo; there was a
merry twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;that I may lay claim
to being the oldest resident of this town. No
doubt I was able to give him some valuable information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is&mdash;is gone?&rdquo; Marian gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left this morning. Why? Did you wish to
see him? Surely&mdash;yes, you would. Being connected
with the reindeer business, you would.
Unfortunate that you did not reach here a few
hours earlier. He left on foot. The trail around
the rapids is rough. He did not try to bring his
dogs and sleds through. Left them with his
driver at the foot of the rapids. Well enough
that he did. Couldn&rsquo;t have made it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Upon realizing that she had missed the man
she had come so far to see, Marian could have
burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may find him at the Station, though,&rdquo;
her host assured her. &ldquo;I believe he means to
stay there a day or two. His dogs are footsore
from travelling over crusted snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian&rsquo;s heart gave a leap of joy. But what
was this about the trail and the rapids?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you say that one could not pass
over the trail with a sled?&rdquo; she asked in the
calmest tone she could command. &ldquo;Are the
rapids not yet frozen over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frozen?&rdquo; he stared at her incredulously.
&ldquo;Have you not heard them? Ah, then, you
came from up stream. The forest shuts out the
sound. Slip on your parka and come with me,
and you shall hear. It is grand music, that ceaseless
rush and roar, that beating of waters and
tumbling of ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may have seemed glorious to the old man,
but to Marian, who listened to the wild tumult of
waters, it was frightening and disheartening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can a boat run the rapids?&rdquo; she asked,
though she knew the question was foolish and
that no boat could run them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None ever has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&mdash;can a sled pass over the trail above?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None has. None can. The way is too
rough; the trees too closely crowded together.
Dogs, reindeer, men, yes; but sleds, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the station?&rdquo; Marian faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any houses on the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, without our sleds, we would not dare
undertake the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It would not do. You would starve or
freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It required all Marian&rsquo;s power of will to remain
standing as she faltering said; &ldquo;Then we
are defeated. We&mdash;we must turn back.
We&mdash;&rdquo; She could not go on.</p>
<p>The aged man studied her face for a moment.
Then quietly he asked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very important that you get to the station;
that you see the Agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very, very important! We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he motioned for silence. &ldquo;Do not tell
me now. I think it can be arranged that your
sleds may pass the rapids. It <i>shall</i> be arranged.
I promise it. Come, you are worn out. It is
time you should sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />AGE SERVES YOUTH</h2>
<p>The two girls had carried no suit-case, satchel
or duffel bag on this trip. Their spare clothing
was stowed away in their sleeping bags. When
their host had lighted their way to the room that
was to be theirs for the night, and had retired
to his large room, they tip-toed back to their
sleds, unlashed their sleeping bags and carried
them as they were to their room.</p>
<p>For some hours Marian had not thought of
the ancient treasure found in the cave, but once
she began unrolling her sleeping bag she was
reminded of it. A piece of old ivory went clattering
to the floor. With a cry of surprise she
picked it up, then carefully removed the other
pieces of ivory, copper and ancient pottery and
stood them in a row against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Again there came the temptation to give them
a thorough examination. Events transpired
later that caused her to wish that she had done
so. But weary and troubled by the turn affairs
had taken, she again put off this inviting task.
She slipped at once into her sleeping gown and
plunged beneath the covers of the most delightful
bed she had ever known. Attatak followed
her a few seconds later.</p>
<p>They found themselves lying upon a bed of
springy moss mixed with the fragrant tips of
balsam. Over this had been thrown wolfskin
robes. With one of these beneath them, and
two above, they snuggled down until only their
noses were showing.</p>
<p>They did not sleep at once. Left to himself,
the mysterious old man had seated himself at his
organ, and now sent forth such wild, pealing
tones as Marian had never heard before. He
was doing Dvorjak&rsquo;s wildest symphony, and
making it wilder and more weird than even the
composer himself could have dreamed it might be
made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Throughout its rendition, Marian lay tense as
a bow-string. As it ended with a wild, racing
crash, she settled back with a shiver, wondering
what could throw such a spell over an old man
as would cause him to play in that manner.</p>
<p>Had she known the reason she would have
done little sleeping that night. The aged host
was tuning his soul to such a key as would nerve
him for a Herculean task.</p>
<p>Since Marian did not know, she puzzled for a
time over the trail they must travel in the morning;
wondered vaguely how her host was to keep
his promise of bringing their sleds safely past
the rapids; then fell asleep.</p>
<p>As for their host, fifteen minutes after the last
note of his wild symphony had died away, he
tip-toed down the silent corridor which led to
the door of the room in which the girls were
sleeping. Having convinced himself by a
moment of listening that they were asleep, he
made his way to the spot where their two sleds
had been left. These he examined carefully.
After straightening up, he murmured:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Took their sleeping-bags. That&rsquo;s bad.
Didn&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em. Can&rsquo;t disturb &rsquo;em now. Guess
it can be managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After delivering himself of this monologue,
he proceeded to wrap the contents of each sled
in a water-proof blanket, then dragged them
out into the moonlight.</p>
<p>Having strapped an axe, a pick and a shovel
on one sled, he tied the other sled to it and began
pulling them over the smooth downhill trail that
led toward the falls.</p>
<p>For a full mile he plodded stolidly on. Then
he halted, separated the sleds, and with the foremost
sled gliding on before him, plunged down
a steep bank to the right. Presently he came toiling
back up the hill for the other sled.</p>
<p>At the bottom once more, he stood for a
moment staring into the foaming depths of a
roaring torrent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Never did it
before at this time of year. Might fail.
Might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Suddenly he broke off and began humming,
&ldquo;Tum&mdash;te&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum.&rdquo; He was going
over and over that mad symphony. It appeared
to give him strength and courage, and
seizing the pick, he began hacking away at some
object that lay half buried in the snow.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later he had exhumed a short,
square raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built you for other purposes, but you&rsquo;ll do
for this,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Other logs where you
came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set both sleds carefully upon the raft; then
with yards upon yards of rawhide rope, lashed
them solidly to it.</p>
<p>This done, he began running out a heavier
rope. This he carried up the bank to a spot
where there was a mass of jagged rock covered
here and there by hard packed snow.</p>
<p>More than once he slipped, but always he
struggled upward until at last he stood upon
the topmost pinnacle. A heroic figure silhouetted
in the moonlight, he stood for a full five minutes
staring down at the racing waters below. Dancing
in the moonlight, they appeared to reach
out black hands to grasp and drag him down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Before him, on the opposite side, gleamed a
high white bank. A sheer precipice of ice fifty
feet high, this was the end of a glacier that every
now and again sent a thousand tons of ice thundering
into the deep pool at its foot.</p>
<p>Beneath this ice barrier the water had worn a
channel. A boat drifting down on the rushing
waters would certainly be sucked down beneath
this ice and be crushed like an eggshell.</p>
<p>What the old man intended to do was evident
enough. He meant to set the raft, laden with the
sleds and trappings so precious to his young
guests, afloat in those turbulent waters and then
to attempt by means of the rope to hold it from
being drawn beneath the ice, and to guide it a
half mile down the river to quieter waters below.
There was no path for him to follow.
Jagged rocks and ice-like snow, slippery as glass,
awaited him; yet he dared to try it.</p>
<p>Here was a task fit for the youngest and the
strongest; yet there he stood, the spirit of a hero
flowing in his veins&mdash;age serving youth. The
gallantry of a great and perfect gentleman bowing
to fair ladies and daring all. How Marian
would have thrilled at sight of this daring act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>With a swift turn he tightened the rope, then
with the &ldquo;de&mdash;de&mdash;dum&rdquo; of his symphony
upon his lips, strained every muscle until he felt
the rope slack, then eased away as he saw the
raft tilt for the glide. Then he relaxed his muscles
and stood there watching.</p>
<p>With a slow graceful movement the small raft
glided out upon the water. An eddy seized
it and whirled it about. Three times it turned,
then the current caught it, and whirled it away.
The rope was tight now, and every muscle of the
grand old man was tense. A battle had begun
which was to decide whether or not the two girls
were to reach the station and fulfill their
mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THE TRAIL OF BLOOD</h2>
<p>That same evening Patsy made her second
startling discovery. An hour before night was
to set in, she had harnessed a sled deer and
struck out into the hills in search of a brown
yearling that had been missing for two days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange where they all go,&rdquo; she murmured as
she climbed a hill for a better view of the surrounding
country. &ldquo;Marian was right; unless
we discover the cause of these disappearances
and put an end to them, soon there will be no
herd. It&rsquo;s a shame! How I wish I could make
the discovery all by myself and surprise Marian
with the good news when she gets home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she scanned the horizon away across to
the west, she saw a single dark figure on the
crest of a hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Omnap-puk,&rdquo; she said, taking in with
admiration the full sweep of his splendid antlers.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen him for a long
while. We can&rsquo;t lose you, can we? And we
can&rsquo;t catch you,&rdquo; she said, speaking to the lone
figure.</p>
<p>Old Omnap-puk was neither reindeer nor caribou;
at least this was what Marian had said
about it. She believed that he was a cross-breed&mdash;half
reindeer and half caribou. He was large
like a caribou, larger than the largest deer in the
herd. He had something of the dark brown coat
of the caribou, but a bright white spot on his left
side told of the reindeer blood that flowed in his
veins.</p>
<p>But he was very wild. Haunting the edge of
the herd, he never came close enough to be lassoed
or driven into a brush corral. Many a
wild chase had he lead the herders, but always
he had shown them his sleek brown heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Many times the girls had debated the question
of allowing the herders to kill him for food and
for his splendid coat; yet they had hesitated.
They were not sure that he was not a full-blooded
reindeer; that he was not marked and
did not belong to someone. If he was a stray
reindeer, they had no right to kill him. Besides
this, it seemed a pity to kill such a wonderful
creature. So the matter stood. And here he was
on their feeding ground.</p>
<p>As Patsy stood there gazing at this splendid
creature, she slowly realized that the Arctic sun
had flamed down below the far horizon and long
shadows raced out of the West. A full orbed
moon stood just atop the trees that lined the
eastern rim of hills. Turning reluctantly to
leave, her eyes caught sight of a dark spot in
the snow. She bent over to examine it, and a
moment later straightened up with a startled
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood! It is a trail of blood. I wonder
which way it goes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to answer this question, she decided to
circle until she could find some sign that would
tell her whether or not she was back-tracking.
Satisfied at last of the direction, she pushed on,
and there in the eerie moonlight, through the
ghostly silence of an Arctic night, she silently
followed the trail of blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Suddenly she stopped and stood still. Just
before her was a large discoloration of the snow.
And, though the snow was so wind packed that
she walked on it without snowshoes, her keen
eyes detected spots where it had been broken
and scratched by some hard, heavy object.</p>
<p>Dropping on her knees, she began examining
every detail of the markings. When she arose
she spoke with a quiet tone of conviction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the track of a man. He has killed
one of our deer and had been carrying it on his
shoulder. Blood dropped from the still warm
carcass. That explains the trail of blood. The
load has become too heavy for him. At this spot
he has laid his burden down. In places the antlers
have scratched the snow. After a time he
has gone on. But which way did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she bent over. On the hard packed
snow, the sole of a skin boot makes no tracks.
After a moment&rsquo;s study she again straightened
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long scratch, as if he had dragged
the carcass to his shoulder as he started on, and
an antler had dragged for two or three feet.
That would indicate that he went the way I have
been going. Question is, shall I go farther, or
shall I go for the herders with their rifles?&rdquo; She
decided to go on.</p>
<p>The blood spots grew less and less as she advanced.
She was beginning to despair of being
able to follow much farther, when, with a
startled gesture, she came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame!&rdquo; she said in an awed
whisper.</p>
<p>It was true. As she stared down at a little
willow lined valley, she saw the outline of a tent.
From the very center of it there appeared to
burst that weird purple light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I am at least sure
that they&rsquo;ve killed one of our deer; killed several,
probably. No doubt they have been living off our
herd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>For a moment she stood there undecided; then,
with reluctant feet, she turned back. It was the
only wise thing to do. She was alone and unarmed.
To follow that trail further would be
dangerous and foolhardy.</p>
<p>But what should she do, once she had reached
her own camp? She was convinced in her own
mind that the slain creature was one of their
deer; yet she could not prove it. Should she lead
her armed herders to the stranger&rsquo;s tent and demand
an explanation? Oh, how she did wish
that Marian was here!</p>
<p>As she walked homeward she felt terribly
depressed. There was a girl in that tent of the
purple flame. She had seen her. She had hoped
that sometime, in the not too distant future, they
might be friends. Such a friend in this lonely
land, especially since Marian and Attatak were
gone, would be a boon indeed. Now she felt
that such a thing could never be. It was as if
a great gulf had suddenly yawned between
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>After reaching her camp and sipping a cup of
tea and munching at some hard crackers, she sat
for hours thinking things through. Her final
decision was that for the present she could do
nothing. Marian might return any day now. In
such matters her judgment would be best and
Patsy did not feel warranted in starting what
might prove to be a dangerous feud.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />PASSING THE RAPIDS</h2>
<p>As the raft, which had been dragged from the
bank of the river by the hermit of the mysterious
lodge, swung out into the ice strewn current, it
shot directly for the glacier&rsquo;s end as if drawn
by a magnet.</p>
<p>Taking a quick turn of the rope about a point
of rock, the aged man braced himself for the
shock which must come when the raft, with its
load of sleds and other trappings, had taken up
the slack.</p>
<p>All too soon it came. Bracing himself as best
he could, he held his ground. The strain increased.
It seemed that the rope must snap;
that the old man&rsquo;s iron grip must yield. Should
the raft reach the glacier it would be lost forever.
The muscles in the man&rsquo;s arms played like
bands of steel. Blood vessels stood out on his
temples like whipcords, yet he held his ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Ten seconds passed, twenty, thirty, then with a
whirl like some wild animal yielding to its captor,
the raft swung about and shot away down
stream.</p>
<p>Plunging forward, leaping rocks, gliding over
glassy surfaces of snow, puffing, perspiring, the
old man followed.</p>
<p>Now he was down; the cause seemed lost. But
in a flash he was up again, clutching at a jagged
rock that tore his hand. For a second time he
stayed the mad rush of the raft. Then he was on
again.</p>
<p>Bobbing from reef to reef, plunging through
foam, leaping high above the torrents, the raft
went careering on. Twice it all but turned over,
and but for the skill of its master would have
been crushed by great grinding cakes of ice.</p>
<p>For thirty long minutes the battle lasted; minutes
that seemed hours to the aged man. Then
with a sigh he guided the raft into a safe eddy
of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Sinking down upon a hard packed bank of
snow, he lay there as if dead. For a long time
he lay there, then rising stiffly, made his way
down the ledge to drag the raft ashore and unlash
the sleds. After this he drew the sleds up
the hill one at a time and set them across the
blazed trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;A good night&rsquo;s work
done, and a neat one. I could not have done it
better twenty years ago. &lsquo;Grow old along with
me,&rsquo;&rdquo; he threw back his hair as if in defiance
of raging torrents, &ldquo;&lsquo;The best is yet to be. The
last of life, for which the first was made&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered this bit of poetical oration
to the tune of the booming rapids, he turned
to pick his way back over the uncertain trail that
led to his strange abode.</p>
<p>Eight hours after she had crept into the luxurious
bed in the guest room of the strange
lodge, Marian stirred, then half awake, felt the
drowsy warmth of wolf-skin rugs. For a moment
she lay there and inhaled the drug-like perfume
of balsam and listened to the steady breathing
of the Eskimo girl beside her. She was
about to turn over for another sleep, when, from
some cell of her brain where it had been stowed
the night before, there came the urge that told
her she must make haste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haste! Haste! Haste!&rdquo; came beating in
upon her drowsy senses. It was as if her brain
were a radio, and the message was coming from
the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly she sat bolt upright. At the same
instant she found herself wide awake, fully
alert and conscious of the problems she must
face that day&mdash;the passing of the rapids and
covering a long span of that trail which still
lay between them and their goal.</p>
<p>She did not waken Attatak. That might not
be necessary for another hour. She sprang out
upon the heavy bear skin rug, and there went
through a set of wild, whirling gestures that
limbered every muscle in her body and sent the
red blood racing through her veins. After that
she quickly slipped into her blouse, knickers,
stockings and deerskin boots, to at last go tiptoeing
down the corridor toward the large living-room
where she heard the roar of the open fire
as it raced up the chimney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>She found her host sitting by the fire. In the
uncertain light he appeared haggard and worn,
as if quite done in from some great exertion.
Of course Marian could not so much as guess
how he had spent the night. She had slept
through it all.</p>
<p>With a smile of greeting the old man motioned
her to a seat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not begrudge an old man a half hour&rsquo;s
company?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wish to ask me things. Everyone who
passes this way wants to. Mostly they ask and
I don&rsquo;t tell. A fair lady, though,&rdquo; there was
something of ancient gallantry in his tone, &ldquo;fair
ladies usually ask what they will and get it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he sat staring silently into the
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This house,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;is a bit unusual.
That pipe organ, for instance&mdash;you
wouldn&rsquo;t expect it here. It came here as if by
accident; Providence, I call it. A rich young
man had more things than he knew what to do
with. The Creator sent some of them to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me, I came here voluntarily. You
have probably taken me for a prospector. I have
never bought pick nor pan. There are things
that lure me, but gold is not one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had troubles before I came here. Troubles
are the heritage of the aged. I sometimes think
that it is not well to live too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he shook himself free of the mood;
his face lighting up as he exclaimed, &ldquo;And yet,
life is very wonderful! Wonderful, even up
here in the frozen north. I might almost say,
<i>especially</i> here in the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to be alone. I brought in food
with a dog team. I built a cabin of logs, and
here I lived for a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a young man came up the river in
a wonderful pleasure yacht and anchored at the
foot of the rapids. Being a lover of music,
he had built a pipe organ into his yacht; the one
you heard last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And did&mdash;did he die?&rdquo; Marian asked, a little
break coming in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the old man smiled, &ldquo;he tarried too
long. Being a lover of nature&mdash;a hunter and
an expert angler&mdash;and having found the most
ideal spot in the world as long as summer lasted,
he stayed on after the frosts and the first snow.
I was away at the time, else I would have warned
him. I returned the day after it happened.
There had been a heavy freeze far up the
river, then a storm came that broke the ice
away. The ice came racing down over the
rapids like mad and wrecked his wonderful yacht
beyond all repair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did as much as we could about getting
the parts on shore; saved almost all but the
hull. He stayed with me for a few days; then,
becoming restless, traded me all there was left
of his boat for my dog team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That winter, with the help of three Indians
and their dogs, I brought the wreckage up here.
Gradually, little by little, I have arranged it
into the form of a home that is as much like a
boat as a house. The organ was unimpaired,
and here it sings to me every day of the great
white winter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>He ceased speaking and for a long time was
silent. When he spoke again his tones were
mellow with kindness and a strange joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seldom lonely now. The woods and
waters are full of interesting secrets. Travellers,
like you, come this way now and again. I try
to be prepared to serve them; to be their
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May&mdash;may I ask one question?&rdquo; Marian
suggested timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know I was at the door last
night when you were playing? You did not
see me. You couldn&rsquo;t have heard me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;is a question I should
like to ask someone myself; someone much wiser
than I am. I knew you were there. I had been
feeling your presence for more than an hour
before you came. I knew I had an audience. I
was playing for them. How did I know? I
cannot tell. It has often been so before. Perhaps
all human presence can be felt by some
specially endowed persons. It may be that in the
throngs of great cities the message of soul to
soul is lost, just as a radio message is lost in a
jumble of many messages sent at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;why speculate?
Life&rsquo;s too short. Some things we must accept as
they are. What&rsquo;s more important to you is
that your sleds are beyond the rapids. When
breakfast is over, you can strap your sleeping
bags on your deer and I will guide you over the
trail around the rapids to the point where I left
your sleds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of consternation flashed over Marian&rsquo;s
face. She was thinking of the ancient dishes and
how fragile they were. &ldquo;I have some fragile
articles in the sleeping bags,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&mdash;they
might break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break?&rdquo; He wore a puzzled look.</p>
<p>For a second she hesitated; then, reassured
by the kindly face of the gentle old man, decided
to tell him the story of their adventure in the
cave. Then she launched into the story with all
the eagerness of a discoverer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, when she had finished the
story. &ldquo;I know just how you feel. However,
there is now only one safe thing to do. Leave
these treasures with me. If the rapids are frozen
over when the time comes for the return trip,
you can pass here and get them. You&rsquo;ll always
be welcome. Better leave an address to which
they may be sent in case you should not pass
this way. The rapids freeze over every winter.
I will surely be able to get them off on the
first river boat. They can be sent to any spot
in the world. To attempt to pack them over on
your deer would mean certain destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctant as Marian was to leave the treasure
behind, she saw the wisdom of his advice. So,
feeling a perfect confidence in him, she decided
to leave her treasure in his care. Then she
gave him her address at Nome, with instructions
for shipping should she fail to return this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more I wanted to ask you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;How many men are there at the Station?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One man; the trader. He stays there the
year &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One man!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is all. Time was when there were
twenty. Prospectors, traders, Indians, trappers.
Two years ago forest fires destroyed the timber.
The game sought other feeding grounds and the
trappers, traders and Indians went with them.
Gold doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist in the streams hereabouts,
so the prospectors have left, too. Now
one man keeps the post; sort of holding on, I
guess, just to see if the old days won&rsquo;t return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he could&mdash;could leave for a
week or two?&rdquo; Marian faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess not. Company wouldn&rsquo;t permit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; Marian set her lips tight.
She would not worry this kind old man with
her troubles. The fact remained, however, that
if there was but one man at the Station, and he
could not leave, there was no one who could be
delegated by the Government Agent to go back
with her to help fight her battles against Scarberry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Suddenly, as she thought of the weary miles
they had travelled, of the hardships they had
endured, and of the probability that they would,
after all, fail in fulfilling their mission, she felt
very weak and as one who has suddenly grown
old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />A MESSAGE FROM THE AIR</h2>
<p>A cup of perfect coffee, followed by a dash
into the bracing Arctic morning, completely revived
Marian&rsquo;s spirits. Casting one longing look
backward at the mysterious treasure of ancient
dishes and old ivory, throwing doubt and discouragement
to the winds, with energy and
courage she set herself to face the problems of
the day.</p>
<p>The passing of the rapids by the overland trail
was all that their host had promised. Struggling
over rocky, snow-packed slopes; slipping, sliding,
buffeted by strong winds, beaten back by swinging
overhanging branches of ancient spruce and
firs, they made their way pantingly forward until
at last, with a little cry of joy, Marian saw their
own sleds in the trail ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;How thankful
I am that we did not attempt to make it
with the sleds, or with our treasure on the backs
of the deer. There would not have been
left a fragment of our dishes as big as a dime.
As for the sleds, well it simply couldn&rsquo;t be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No-me</i>,&rdquo; sighed Attatak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how he could have brought them
by the rapids?&rdquo; Marian mused as she examined
the sleds. There were flakes of ice frozen to the
runners. She could only guess at the method he
had used, only dimly picture the struggle it must
have taken. Even as she attempted to picture
the night battle, a great wave of admiration and
trust swept over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure is safer in his hands than in
ours,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after it has left his hands?&rdquo; questioned
her doubting self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;what must be,
will be. The important thing after all is to
reach the station before the Agent has started
on his way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Again her brow clouded. What if there was
no one to go back with her?</p>
<p>To dispel this doubt, she hastened to hitch her
deer to her sled. Soon they were racing away
over the trail, causing the last miles of their long
journey to melt away like ice in the river before
a spring thaw.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime a third startling revelation
had come to Patsy. First she had discovered
that at least one of the persons connected with
the strange purple flame was a girl. Next she
had found the red trail of blood that apparently
was made by one of Marian&rsquo;s slain deer, and
which led to the door of their tent. The third
discovery had nothing to do with the first two,
nor with the purple flame. It was of a totally
different nature, and was most encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Marian were here!&rdquo; she said to
herself as she paced the floor after receiving
the important message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>This message came to her over the radiophone.
It was not meant particularly for her,
nor for Marian. It was just news; not much
more than a rumor, at that. Yet such news as it
was, if only it were true!</p>
<p>Faint and far away, it came drifting in upon
the air from some powerful sending station.
Perhaps that station was Fairbanks, Dawson or
Nome. She missed that part of the message.</p>
<p>Only this much came to her that night as she
sat at their compact, powerful receiving set, beguiling
the lonesome hours by catching snatches
of messages from near and far:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumor has it that the Canadian Government
plans the purchase of reindeer to be given to her
Eskimo people on the north coast of the Arctic.
Five or six hundred will be purchased as an experiment,
if the plan carries. It seems probable
that the deer purchased will be procured in
Alaska. It is thought possible to drive herds
across the intervening space and over the line
from Alaska, and that in this way they may be
purchased by the Canadian Agent on Canadian
soil. A call for such herds may be issued later
over the radio, as it is well known that many
owners of herds have their camps equipped with
radio-phones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>There the message ended. It had left Patsy
in a fever of excitement. Marian and her father
wished to sell the herd. It was absolutely necessary
to sell it if Marian&rsquo;s hopes of continuing
her education were not to be blasted. There was
no market now for a herd in Alaska. In the
future, as pastures grew scarcer, and as herds
increased in numbers, there would be still less
opportunity for a sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful opportunity!&rdquo; Patsy exclaimed.
&ldquo;To sell the whole herd to a Government
that would pay fair prices and cash! And
what a glorious adventure! To drive a reindeer
herd over hundreds of miles of rivers, forests,
tundra, hills and mountains; to camp each night
in some spot where perhaps no man has been
before; surely that would be wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Just at that moment there entered her mind a
startling thought. Scarberry&rsquo;s camp, too, was
equipped with a radio-phone. Probably he, too,
at this very moment, was smiling at the prospect
of selling six hundred of his deer. He wanted
to sell. Of course he did. Everyone did. He
would make the drive. Certainly he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she breathed, pressing her hands
to her fluttering heart, &ldquo;then it will be a race;
a race between two reindeer herd; a race over
hundreds of miles of wilderness for a grand
prize. What a glorious adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Marian were here,&rdquo; she sighed again.
&ldquo;The message announcing the plans may come
while she is gone. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat in a study for a long time. Finally
she whispered to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the message comes while she is gone; if
the opportunity is sure to be lost unless the herd
starts as soon as the message comes, I wonder if
I&rsquo;d dare to start on the race with the herd, with
Terogloona and without Marian and Attatak.
I wonder if I would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time she sat staring at the fire.
Perhaps she was attempting to read the answer
in the flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>At last, with cheeks a trifle flushed, she sprang
to her feet, did three or four leaps across the
floor, and throwing off her clothing, crept between
the deer-skins in the strange little sleeping
compartment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />FADING HOPES</h2>
<p>Just at dawn of a wonderfully crisp morning,
Marian found herself following her reindeer
over a trail that had recently been travelled by
a dog team. She was just approaching the Trading
Station where the questions that haunted her
tired brain would be answered.</p>
<p>Since leaving the cabin in the forest above the
rapids, she and Attatak had travelled almost day
and night. A half hour for a hasty lunch here
and there, an hour or two for sleep and for permitting
the deer to feed; that was all they had
allowed themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>An hour earlier, Marian had felt that she
could not travel another mile. Then they had
come upon the trail of the dog team, and realizing
that they were nearing their goal, her
blood had quickened like a marathon racer&rsquo;s at
the end of his long race. No longer feeling
fatigue, she urged her weary reindeer forward.
Contrary to her usually cautious nature, she even
cast discretion to the winds and drove her
deer straight toward the settlement. That there
were dogs which might attack her deer she knew
right well. That they were not of the species
that attacked deer, or that they were chained,
was her hope.</p>
<p>So, with her heart throbbing, she rounded a
sudden turn to find herself within sight of a
group of low-lying cabins that at one time had
been a small town.</p>
<p>Now, as her aged host had said, it was a town
in name only. She knew this at a glance. One
look at the chimneys told her the place was all
but deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No smoke,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one smoke,&rdquo; Attatak said, pointing.</p>
<p>It was true. From one long cabin there curled
a white wreath of smoke.</p>
<p>For a moment Marian hesitated. No dogs had
come out to bark, yet they might be there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You stay with the deer,&rdquo; she said to Attatak.
&ldquo;Tether them strongly to the sleds. If dogs
come, beat them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was away like an arrow. Straight to that
cabin of the one smoke she hurried. She caught
her breath as she saw a splendid team of dogs
standing at the door. Someone was going on a
trip. The sled was loaded for the journey. Was
it the Agent&rsquo;s sled? Had she arrived in time?</p>
<p>She did not have long to wait before knowing.
She had come within ten feet of the cabin when
a tall, deep-chested man opened the door and
stepped out. She caught her breath. Instantly
she knew him. It was the Agent.</p>
<p>He, in turn, recognized her, and with cap
in hand and astonishment showing in his eyes,
he advanced to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why Marian
Norton, you belong in Nome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I did,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;but now I belong
on the tundra with our herd. It is the herd that
has brought me here. May I speak to you about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you may. But you look tired and
hungry. The Trader has a piping Mulligan stew
on the stove. It will do you good. Come inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Indian boy, who made his home with the
Trader, was dispatched to relieve Attatak of
her watch, and Marian sat down to enjoy a delicious
repast.</p>
<p>There are some disappointments that come
to us so gradually that, though the matters they
effect are of the utmost importance, we are not
greatly shocked when at last their full meaning
is unfolded to us. It was so with Marian. She
had dared and endured much to reach this spot.
She had arrived at the critical moment. An
hour later the Agent would have been gone. The
Agent was her friend. Ready to do anything he
could to help her, he would gladly have gone
back with her to assist in defending her rights.
But duty called him over another trail. He had
no one, absolutely no one to send from this post
to execute his orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said after hearing her story,
&ldquo;I can give you a note to that outlaw, Scarberry,
but he&rsquo;d pay no attention to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d tear it up and throw it in my face,&rdquo;
asserted Marian stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the Agent,
rising and walking the floor. &ldquo;There is Ben
Neighbor over at the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain.
His cabin is only three days travel from
your camp. He&rsquo;s a good man, and a brave one.
He is a Deputy Marshal. If I give you a note to
him, he will serve you as well as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we need take a different trail home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Which way did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian described their course. The Agent
whistled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you didn&rsquo;t perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a rough map of the
country. I will mark out the course to Ben&rsquo;s
cabin. You&rsquo;ll find it a much safer way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Thanks.
That&rsquo;s surely the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the treasure left at the
cabin. She had hoped to return by that route
and claim it. Now that hope was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />A FRUITLESS JOURNEY</h2>
<p>It was night; such a night as only the Arctic
knows. Cold stars, gleaming like bits of burnished
silver in the sky, shone down upon vast
stretches of glistening snow. Out of that whiteness
one object loomed, black as ink against the
whiteness of its background.</p>
<p>Weary with five days of constant travel,
Marian found herself approaching this black
bulk. She pushed doggedly forward, expecting
at every moment to catch a lightning-like zig-zag
flash of purple flame shooting up the side of it.</p>
<p>The black bulk was the old dredge in Sinrock
River. She had passed that way twice before.
Each time she had hoped to find there a haven of
rest, and each time she had been frightened away
by the flash of the purple flame. Those mysterious
people had left this spot at one time. Had
they returned? Was the dredge now a place of
danger, or a haven for weary travellers? The
answer to this question was only to be found
by marching boldly up to the dredge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>This called for courage. Born with a brave
soul, Marian was equal to any emergency. Sheer
weariness and lack of sleep added to this a touch
of daring.</p>
<p>Without pausing, she drove straight up to the
door. Reassured by the snow banked up against
it, she hastily scooped away the bank with her
snow-shoe, and having shoved the door open,
boldly entered.</p>
<p>It was a cheerless place, black and empty.
The wind whistled through the cracks where the
planks had rotted away. Yet it was a shelter.
Passing through another door, she found herself
in an inner room that housed the boiler of the
engine that had furnished power to the dredge.
The boiler, a great red drum of rust, stood
directly in front of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we camp,&rdquo; she said to Attatak.
&ldquo;We can build a fire in the fire-box of the boiler
and broil some steak. That will be splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; grinned Attatak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Attatak, bring the deer through the
outer door, then close it. They were fed two
hours ago. That will do until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lighted a candle, gathered up some bits of
wood that lay strewn about the narrow room,
and began to kindle a fire while Attatak went out
after the deer.</p>
<p>For the moment, being alone, she began to
think of the herd. How was the herd faring?
What had happened to Patsy during those many
days of her absence? Were Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s
deer rapidly destroying her herd ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they are, we are powerless to prevent
it,&rdquo; she told herself with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>As she looked back upon it now, she felt that
her whole journey had been a colossal failure.
They had discovered the mountain cave treasure,
only to be obliged to leave the treasure behind.
They had reached the Station in time to talk
with the Government Agent, but he had not been
able to come with her. Only twenty-four hours
before they had reached the cabin of Ben Neighbor,
only to find it dark and deserted. He had
gone somewhere, as people in the Arctic have a
way of doing; and where that might be she could
not even hazard a guess. At last, in despair, she
had headed her deer toward her own camp. In
thirty-six hours she would be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;it will be a
pleasure to see Patsy and to sleep the clock round
in our own sweet little deerskin bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was indeed to see Patsy, but the privilege
of sleeping the clock round was not to be hers
for many a day. She was destined to find the
immediate future far too stirring for that.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later saw Marian well on
her way home. Ten hours more, she felt sure,
would bring her to camp. And then what? She
could not even guess. Had she been able to
even so much as suspect what was going on at
camp, she would have urged her reindeer to do
their utmost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p class="tb">Patsy was right in the middle of a peck of
trouble. Because of the fact that for the last
few days she had been living in a realm of exciting
dreams, the troubles that had come down
upon her seemed all the more grievous. Since
that most welcome radio message regarding the
proposed purchase of reindeer by the Canadian
Government had come drifting in over the air,
she had, during every available moment, hovered
over the radio-phone in the momentary expectation
of receiving the confirmation of that rumor
which might send the herd over mountains and
tundra in a wild race for a prize, a prize worth
thousands of dollars to her uncle and cousin&mdash;the
sale of the herd.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of her too close application
to the radio-phone that she failed to note
the approach of Scarberry&rsquo;s herd as it returned
to ravish their feeding ground. Certain it was
that the first of the deer, with the entire herd
close upon their heels, were already over the
hills before she knew of their coming.</p>
<p>It was night when Terogloona brought this bit
of disquieting news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this time,&rdquo; Patsy wailed, &ldquo;we have not
so much as one hungry Eskimo with his dog to
send against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to the complaint, the aged
herder plucked at her sleeve, then led her out
beneath the open sky.</p>
<p>With an impressive gesture, he waved his
arm toward the distant hills that lay in the
opposite direction of Scarberry&rsquo;s herd. To her
great surprise and mystification, she saw gleaming
there the lights of twenty or more campfires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U-bogok</i>,&rdquo; (see there) he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what does it mean?&rdquo; Patsy stammered,
grasping at her dry throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that I fear,&rdquo; said Terogloona. &ldquo;They
come. To-morrow they are here. You gave
food for a week for a few; flour, sugar, bacon.
They like him. Now come whole village of
Sitne-zok. Want food. You gave them food.
What you think? No food for herders, no
herders. No herders, no herd. What you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Patsy did not know what to think. Gone was
all her little burst of pride over the way she had
handled the other situation that had confronted
her. Now she felt that she was but a girl, a
very small girl, and very, very much alone. She
wished Marian would come. Oh, how she did
wish that she would come!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning we will see what can be
done,&rdquo; was all she could say to the faithful old
herder as she turned to re-enter the igloo.</p>
<p>That night she did not undress. She sat up
for hours, trying to think of some way out. She
sat long with the radio head-set over her ears.
She entertained some wild notion of fleeing with
the herd toward the Canadian border, providing
the message confirming the offer for the deer
came. But the message did not come.</p>
<p>At last, in utter exhaustion, she threw herself
among the deerskins and fell into a troubled
sleep.</p>
<p>She was roused from this sleep by a loud:
&ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; followed by a cheery: &ldquo;Where
are you? Are you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>It was Marian. The next moment poor, tired,
worried Patsy threw herself sobbing into her
cousin&rsquo;s strong arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Marian, soothingly, as
Patsy&rsquo;s sobbing ceased, &ldquo;sit down and tell me all
about it. You&rsquo;re safe; that&rsquo;s something. Your
experiences can&rsquo;t have been worse than ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eskimo! Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s herd!&rdquo; burst
out Patsy, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here. All of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo; encouraged Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get my head-set on,&rdquo; said Patsy,
more hopefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been due for days; may
come at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s due?&rdquo; asked Marian, mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;ll tell you. One thing at a time.
Let&rsquo;s get it all straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began at the beginning and recited all that
had transpired since Marian had left camp.
When she came to tell of her discovery that one
of the mysterious occupants of the tent of the
purple flame was a girl, Marian&rsquo;s astonishment
knew no bounds. When told of the bloody trail,
Marian was up in arms. The camp of the purple
flame must be raided at once. They would put
a stop to that sort of thing. They would take
their armed herders and raid that camp this very
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; Patsy held up a warning finger,
&ldquo;I am not half through yet. There is more.
Too much more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in the midst of recounting her experiences
with the band of wandering Eskimo and
Scarberry&rsquo;s herd, when suddenly she clapped the
radio receiver tightly to her ears and stopped
talking. Then she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming! At last, it is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian, out
of all patience, &ldquo;Will you kindly tell me what is
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Patsy only held the receiver to her ears
and listened the more intently as she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shush! Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />PLANNING THE LONG DRIVE</h2>
<p>The message that was holding Patsy&rsquo;s attention
was one from the Canadian Government. It
was a bonafide offer from that Government to
purchase the first herd of from four to six hundred
reindeer that should reach Fort Jarvis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>When Patsy had imparted the exciting news to
her, Marian sat long in silent thought. Fort
Jarvis, as she well knew, lay some five hundred
miles away over hills and tundra. She had
just returned from one such wearisome journey.
Should she start again? And would this second
great endeavor prove more successful than the
first? Of all the herds in Alaska, two were
closest to Fort Jarvis; Scarberry&rsquo;s and her own.
She had not the slightest doubt that Scarberry
would start driving a section of his herd toward
that goal. It would be a race; a race that would
be won by the bravest, strongest and most skillful.
Marian believed in her herders. She believed
in herself and Patsy. She believed as
strongly in her herd, her sled-deer and her dogs.
It was the grand opportunity; the way out of all
troubles. That the band of begging natives
would not follow, she knew right well. Nor
would the mysterious persons of the purple
flame camp; at least, she hoped not. As for
their little herd range, if they sold their deer,
Scarberry might have it, and welcome; if they
did not sell, they could doubtless find pasture in
some far away Canadian valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a tone of decision, &ldquo;we will
go. We will waken the herders at once. Come
on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they burst breathlessly into the cabin of
their Eskimo herders, they received something of
a shock. Since all the work of the day had long
since been done, they had expected to find the
entire group of four assembled in the cabin, or
asleep in their bunks. But here was only old
Terogloona and Attatak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Oatinna? Where&rsquo;s Azazruk?&rdquo; demanded
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; said Terogloona solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Go call them, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terogloona did not move. He merely
shrugged his shoulders and mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good. Gone long way. Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s
camp. No come back, say that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian in consternation.
&ldquo;Gone? Deserted us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; Terogloona nodded his head. &ldquo;Say
Bill Scarberry pay more money; more deer; say
that one Oatinna, that one Azazruk. No good,
that one Bill Scarberry, me think.&rdquo; He shook
his head solemnly. &ldquo;Not listen that one Oatinna,
that one Azazruk. Say wanna go. Go, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can&rsquo;t start the herd,&rdquo; murmured
Marian, sinking down upon a rolled up sleeping-bag.
&ldquo;Yes, we will!&rdquo; she exclaimed resolutely.
&ldquo;Terogloona, where are the rifles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he repeated like a parrot. &ldquo;Mebby
you forget. That one rifle b&rsquo;long herder boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And your rifle?&rdquo; questioned Marian,
&ldquo;where is your rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke-tuk. Hammer not want come down
hard. Not want shoot, that one rifle, mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian was stunned with surprise and
chagrin. She and Patsy returned silently to
their igloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that treacherous Bill Scarberry!&rdquo; she
exploded. &ldquo;He has known this was coming. He
knew our herders were energetic and capable.
He thought if they remained with us, we might
beat him to the prize; so he sent some spy over
here to buy them away from us with promises of
more pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he will drive his herd to Fort Jarvis
and sell it, and our grand chance is gone
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t! He
shall not! We will beat him yet. We are strong.
Terogloona and Attatak are faithful. We have
our three collies. We can do it. We will beat
him yet. Our herd is better than his. It will
travel faster. Oh, Marian! Somehow, <i>somehow</i>
we must do it. It&rsquo;s your chance! Your one big,
wonderful opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Marian, suddenly fired by
her cousin&rsquo;s hot blooded southern enthusiasm,
&ldquo;we will do it or perish in the attempt. It&rsquo;s
to be a race,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;a race for a wonderful
prize, a race between two large herds of
reindeer over five hundred miles of hills, tundra
and forest. There may be wolves in the forests.
In Alaska dangers lurk at every turn; rivers
too rapid to freeze over and blizzards and wild
beasts. We will be terribly handicapped from
the very start. But for father&rsquo;s sake we must
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your father&rsquo;s and for your own sake,&rdquo;
murmured Patsy. &ldquo;And, Marian, I have always
believed that our great Creator was on the
side of those who are kind and just. Bill Scarberry
played us a mean trick. Perhaps God
will somehow even the score.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>An hour was spent in consultation with old
Terogloona. His face became very sober at
the situation, but in the end, with the blood of
youth coursing eternally in his veins, he sprang
to his feet and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh!</i>&rdquo; (Yes-yes) &ldquo;We will go. Before it
is day we will be away. You go sleep. You
must be very strong. In the morning Terogloona
will have reindeer and sleds ready. We
will call to the dogs. We will be away before
the sun. We will shout &lsquo;<i>Kul-le-a-muck, Kul-le-a-muck</i>&rsquo;
(Hurry! Hurry!) to dogs and reindeer.
We will beat that one Bill yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; he exclaimed, his face
darkening like a thundercloud, &ldquo;You know that
mean man, that one Bill Scarberry. Want my
boy, So-queena, work for him. Want pay him
reindeer. Give him bad rifle, very bad rifle.
Want shoot, my boy So-queena. Shot at carabou,
So-queena. Rifle go flash. Crooch! Just
like that. Shoot back powder, that rifle. Came
in So-queena&rsquo;s eyes, that powder. Can&rsquo;t see,
that one. Almost lost to freeze, that one, So-queena.
Bye&rsquo;m bye find camp. Stay camp
mebby five days. Can see, not very good. Bill,
he say: &lsquo;Go herd reindeer,&rsquo; So-queena, he
say: &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t see. Mebby get lost. Mebby
freeze&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He say Bill very mad. &lsquo;Get out! No
good, you! Go freeze. Who cares?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-queena come my house&mdash;long way.
Plenty starve. Plenty freeze. No give reindeer
that one So-queena, that one Bill. Bad
one, that Bill. So me think; beat Bill. Sell
reindeer herd white man. Think very good.
Work hard. Mebby beat that one Bill Scarberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a look of determination to
Patsy&rsquo;s face such as Marian had never seen
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the kind of man he is; if he would
send an Eskimo boy, half-blinded by his own
worthless rifle, out into the snow and the cold,
then we must beat him. We must! We must!&rdquo;
said Patsy vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of man he is,&rdquo; said
Marian soberly. &ldquo;We must beat him if we
can. But it will be a long, hard journey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>They had hardly crept between their deerskins
when Patsy was fast asleep. Not so
Marian. The full responsibility of this perilous
journey rested upon her shoulders. She
knew too well the hardships and dangers they
must face. They must pass through broad
stretches of forest where food for the deer was
scarce, and where lurking wolves, worn down
to mere skeletons by the scarcity of food,
might attack and scatter their herd beyond recovery.</p>
<p>They must cross high hills, from whose summits
the snow at times poured like smoke from
volcanoes in circling sweeps hundreds of feet
in extent. Here there would be danger of losing
their deer in some wild blizzard, or having
them buried beneath the snows of some thundering
avalanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for myself alone that I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Patsy, Patsy from
Kentucky. Who would have thought a girl
from the sunny south could be so brave, such
a good sport.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>As she thought of the courageous, carefree
manner in which Patsy had insisted on the
journey, a lump rose in her throat, and she
brushed a hand hastily over her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;ought I to
allow her to do it? She&rsquo;s younger than I, and
not so strong. Can she stand the strain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her mind took up the thought of the
perils they must face.</p>
<p>There were wandering tribes of Indians in
the territory they must cross; the skulking and
oft-times treacherous Indians of the Little
Sticks. What if they were to cross the path of
these? What if a great band of caribou should
come pouring down some mountain pass and,
having swallowed up their little herd, go sweeping
on, leaving them in the midst of a great
wilderness with only their sled-deer to stand between
them and starvation.</p>
<p>As if dreaming of Marian&rsquo;s thoughts, Patsy
suddenly turned over with a little sobbing cry,
and wound her arms about Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Marian whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Patsy did not answer. She was still asleep.
The dream soon passed, her muscles relaxed,
and with a deep sigh she sank back into her
place.</p>
<p>This little drama left Marian in an exceedingly
troubled state of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought not to go,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;We
will not.&rdquo; Then, from sheer exhaustion, she
too, fell asleep.</p>
<p>Three hours before the tardy Arctic sunrise,
she heard Terogloona pounding at their door.
She found that sleep had banished fear, and
that every muscle in her body and every cell
of her brain was ready for action, eager to be
away.</p>
<p>As for Patsy, she could not dress half fast
enough, so great was her desire for the wonderful
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />CAMP FOLLOWERS</h2>
<p>It was just as Marian was tightening the
ropes to the pack on her sled that, happening
to glance away at a distant hill, she was reminded
of Patsy&rsquo;s latest story of the purple
flame. From the crest of that hill there came
a purple flare of light. Quickly as it had come,
just so quickly it vanished, leaving the hill a
faint outline against the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I wonder
if we can leave those mysterious camp-followers
of ours behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant a disturbing thought flashed
through her mind. It caused an indignant flash
of color to rise to her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;if those mysterious
people are spies set by Bill Scarberry to
dog our tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They may start with us,&rdquo; she smiled to herself,
as she at last dismissed the subject from
her mind, &ldquo;but unless they really are Bill Scarberry&rsquo;s
spies and set to watch us, they&rsquo;ll never
finish with us. Camp-followers don&rsquo;t follow
over five hundred miles of wild trail. They&rsquo;re
not that fond of hard marching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this conclusion she was partly wrong.</p>
<p>Just as the sun was painting the distant
mountain peaks with a gleam of gold, the collies
began to bark and the broad herd of reindeer
moved slowly forward. Marian and Patsy
touched their deer gently with the reins, and
they were away.</p>
<p>It was with a distinct feeling of homesickness
that Marian turned to look back at the campsite.
She had spent many happy hours there.
Now she was leaving it, perhaps forever. What
was more, she was leaving the tundra; the
broad-stretching deer pastures of the Arctics.
Should their enterprise succeed, she would pass
over one of the Canadian trails, southward to
the States and back to the University. Should
they fail, she might indeed return to the tundra,
but she knew it could never be the same to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must not fail,&rdquo; she told herself, clenching
her hands tight and staring away at the
magnificent panorama which lay before her.
&ldquo;We must not! Must not fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she saw the reindeer, a mass of brown
and white moving down the slope, a feeling of
sadness swept over her. She had come to love
these gentle and half-wild creatures of the
North. She was especially fond of the sled-deer,
her three; the spotted one, the brown one,
and the white. Many hundred miles had she
driven them. Nowhere in the world, she was
sure, could there be deer who covered more
miles in a day, who were quicker to recognize
the pull of rein, more willing to stomp the tiresome
nights away at the ends of their tethers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Dearest of all were the three collie dogs;
Gold, Copper and Bronze, she whimsically
named them, for their coats were just what
their names indicated. Copper and Bronze were
young dogs. Gold was the pick of the three;
an old, well-trained sheep dog. Accustomed to
the sunny pastures of California, he had been
brought to this cold and barren land to herd
reindeer. With the sturdy devotion of his kind,
he had endured the biting cold without a whimper,
and had gnawed his toes, cut by the crusted
snow, in silence. He had done the work assigned
to him with a zeal and thoroughness that
might have shamed many a human master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These, too, I must leave,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Worse than that, I am leading them out into
wild desert. Within a week that beautiful herd
may be hopelessly scattered; our sled-deers killed
by wolves; our dogs&mdash;well, anyway, they will
never desert us. Together we will fight it out
to the bitter end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lump came into her throat. Then, realizing
that she was the commander of this expedition
and that it was unbecoming of commanders to
betray emotion, she quickly conquered her feelings
and gave herself over to the work of assisting
in keeping the herd moving steadily forward
in a compact mass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Five days later, with their herd still moving
steadily on before them, and with hopes rising
high because of the continued success of their
march, they found themselves crossing a succession
of low-lying, grass-covered hills. As
they reached the crest of the highest of these,
and arrived at a place where they could get an
unrestricted view of the tundra that lay beyond,
an exclamation escaped Marian&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A forest!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real Arctic forest,&rdquo; echoed Patsy. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
it be wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful and dangerous,&rdquo; Marian replied.
&ldquo;Unless I miss my guess, here is where our
troubles begin. It may not be so bad, though,&rdquo;
she quickly amended, as she saw the look of
fear that came over her cousin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;That
forest is fully ten miles away. The sun is about
to set. We&rsquo;ll drive our herd down into the
tundra where there is plenty of moss. We&rsquo;ll
camp there, and get up for an early start in
the morning. The forest may be only a narrow
belt along a river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Marian did not feel very sure that her predictions
would prove true, but she was the sort
of person who measures all perils carefully, then
hopes for the best.</p>
<p>Two hours later they were eating a meal of
reindeer stew and hot biscuits, which had been
cooked over a willow-wood fire in their Yukon
stove. Then as they chatted of the future,
Marian held up a finger for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;A
shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. There&rsquo;s another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian was up and out of the tent in an instant.</p>
<p>As her eyes swept the horizon they caught
a gleam of light from the hills above, the red
and yellow light of a camp-fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>With one sweeping glance she took in the position
of her herd. She had just noted that
a certain brown deer had strayed some distance
up the hill. She was about to suggest to Terogloona,
who had also been called from his tent
by the shots, that he send a dog after the deer,
when, to her great astonishment, she caught a
flash of light, heard a sharp report, then saw
the brown deer crumple up like an empty sack
and drop to the snow.</p>
<p>For one instant she stood there as if in a
trance, then with a quick turn she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patsy, you stay with Attatak. Terogloona,
you come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, she walked straight toward the
spot where the reindeer had fallen. The faithful
Terogloona, in spite of his fear of the Indians
of the Little Sticks, followed at her heels.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the spot, they found a
man bending over the dead deer. In his hand
was the rifle that had sped the bullet. The
soft-soled &ldquo;muck-lucks&rdquo; that Marian and Terogloona
wore made no sound on the snow. The
man&rsquo;s back was toward them and they came
upon him unobserved. The powerful Terogloona
would have leaped upon his back and
thrown him to the snow, but Marian held him
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; said the girl, in as steady a voice
as she could, &ldquo;why did you kill our deer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash the man gripped his rifle as he
wheeled about. Then, seeing it was a girl who
spoke, he lowered his weapon.</p>
<p>Marian&rsquo;s eyes took him in with one feeling
glance. His face was haggard, emaciated. His
hands were mere skin and bones. He was an
Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too hungry,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;No come caribou.
No come ptarmigan. No fish in the river;
no rabbits on the tundra!&rdquo; He spread out his
bony hands in a gesture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t have killed him. Had you
come to us we would have given you meat, all
you could use.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s face was frank and
fearless, yet there was a certain huskiness in
her voice that to the sensitive ears of the Indian
betokened kindness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;maybe you would.
Yesterday we saw other reindeer herd, north
mebby ten miles. Want deer; ask man, big
man, much whiskers; say want food. Man
said: &lsquo;Get out!&rsquo; Want&rsquo;a kill me if I not go
quick. Bad man, that one. We go way. Then
see your herd. Say, take one deer. You want
to fight, then fight. Better to die by bullet
than by hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man you saw,&rdquo; said Marian, her heart
sinking as she realized that he must be a half
day in the lead, &ldquo;was Bill Scarberry. Yes, he
is a mean man. But see! Have you a cache?
Some place where you can keep meat from the
wolves and wolverines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian eagerly.
&ldquo;Ten miles. Diesa River, a cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many deer must you have to keep you
until game comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby&mdash;mebby,&rdquo; the Indian stared at her
in astonishment, &ldquo;Mebby two, mebby three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Marian, &ldquo;you have killed
a fine doe. That was bad, but I forgive you.&rdquo;
She held our her hand to grasp the native&rsquo;s
bony fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said briskly, &ldquo;since you have
killed her, you may keep the meat. Terogloona,&rdquo;
she turned to the Eskimo, &ldquo;point out two young
bucks, the best we have. Tell him he may kill
them and that he and his friends may take them
to their cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; the Indian attempted to speak.
Failing utterly, he turned and walked a few
steps away, then turning, struck straight away
toward the spot where the red and yellow campfire
gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is his camp?&rdquo; asked Marian.</p>
<p>Terogloona nodded silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come for the meat, and will give
us no further trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>&rdquo; smiled the Eskimo. &ldquo;The daughter
of my master has acted wisely. The man who
starves, he is different. These reindeer,&rdquo; he
waved his arms toward the herd, &ldquo;they belong
to my master and his daughter. When men
are not starving&mdash;yes. When men are starving&mdash;no.
To the starving all things belong.
Bill Scarberry, he remember yet. Indians of
Little Sticks, they never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>As Marian turned to retrace her steps to
camp, she chanced to glance up at the other
camp where, but an hour before, she had seen
the flash of the purple flame. It was closer
than she thought. The flash of flame was gone,
but she was sure she caught the outlines of a
tent; surer still that she saw a solitary figure
atop a nearby knoll. Sitting as if on watch,
this solitary man held a rifle across his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he is there?&rdquo; she said to
herself, &ldquo;I wonder why they are following us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed as she walked toward
camp, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so tantalizing, that purple flame and
all! I have half a notion to take Terogloona, as
I did with that Indian, and march right up to
them and demand the meaning of their mysterious
actions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if intending to turn this thought into
action at once, she stopped and turned about.
To her surprise, as she looked toward the crest
of the hill, she saw the solitary watcher was
gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;we have no real
reason for invading their camp. We&rsquo;ve no
proof that they&rsquo;ve ever done us any harm; except,
perhaps the time that Patsy saw the
blood-trail and the antler marks in the snow.
It seems that it must have been our deer, but
we never could prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing away at a more distant hill-crest,
she was surprised at the picture revealed there.</p>
<p>The moon, just rising from behind the hill,
threw out in bold relief the broad-spreading
antlers of a magnificent creature of the wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Omnap-puk!&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;What
do you think of that? We have traveled five
days, and yet we are still in the company of
the mysterious camp-followers of the purple
flame and old Omnap-puk, the caribou-reindeer
who has haunted the outskirts of our camp so
long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that I
should tell Terogloona to have the Indians kill
Omnap-puk. That would save one of our reindeers,
and besides, if we let him live, who knows
but that at some critical moment he may rush
in and assume the leadership of our herd and
lead them to disaster, or lose them to us forever.
I have heard of that happening with
horses and cattle. Why not with reindeer?
And yet,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite make up
my mind to do it. He is such a wonderful fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time was to come, and that very soon,
when she was to rejoice because of this decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />THE MIRAGE</h2>
<p>That night Marian lay awake for a long
time. She had a vague feeling that they were
approaching a crisis. Many agencies were at
work. Some appeared to favor the success of
their enterprise, and some were working directly
against them. Scarberry, with his herd, was
some hours ahead of them. That was bad. If
he succeeded in retaining this lead, the race was
lost. However, less than half the distance had
been covered, the easiest half. Many a peril
awaited each herd. Who could tell when prowling
wolves, large bands of Indians, a caribou
herd, an impassable river, might bring either to
a halt?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Marian could not answer all of the questions
that troubled her. The Indians? Would they
be satisfied with her gift of food, or would they
continue to prey upon the herd? Would they
go back to some large tribe and lead them to
the herd that they might drive them away, an
easy bounty?</p>
<p>She had dealt with Eskimos; knew about
what to expect from them. &ldquo;But Indians,&rdquo;
she whispered to herself, &ldquo;What are they like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to her perplexity, there came
to her mind the words of a great and good
man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humanity is everywhere very much the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought gave her comfort. She could
not help but feel that the Indian she had befriended
would not betray her, but might even
come to her aid in some emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those of the purple flame?&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;That silent watcher on the
hill&mdash;what did he mean by sitting there with
a rifle across his knee? Is he and his companions
our friends or our enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Here, indeed, was a problem. Until this day,
she had felt that these persons were to be distrusted
and feared. However, there had been
something about that silent watcher that had
given her a feeling of safety in spite of her
prejudice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was as if he were set there as a watch
to see that the Indian did us no harm,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;And yet, how could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this perplexity that
she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Long before dawn the girls awoke to face a
new day and a new, unknown peril. The forest,
stretching out black and somber against the
white foreground of snow, seemed a great menacing
hand, reaching out to seize their precious
possession. They could not know what perils
awaited them in the forest.</p>
<p>With breakfast over, the tents struck, sled-deer
harnessed and hitched to the sled, and
everything in readiness for the continuing of
the race to Fort Jarvis, the girls climbed the
nearest hill, hoping that they might catch some
glimpse of the country beyond the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Their hopes were vain. Far as eye could see,
the forest stretched before them. They could
only guess the miles they must travel before
coming again to rolling hills and level tundra.
They were traveling over a region of the great
Northland which had never really been explored.
No accurate maps showed where rivers ran or
forests spread out over the plains.</p>
<p>Standing there, looking at the great forest,
Patsy quoted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;This the forest primeval;</p>
<p class="t0">The murmuring pines and the hemlocks</p>
<p class="t0">Stand like Druids of old</p>
<p class="t0">With beards that rest on their bosom.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, with two Eskimos for companions, we
are to enter that forest. Only wild people, and
wilder caribou and wolves, have been there before
us. Oh, Marian! We are explorers! We
really, truly are! Isn&rsquo;t it gran-n-d!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Marian did not answer. There was a puzzled
look on her face as she stared away toward
the north. Out of the very clouds faint
images appeared to be marching. Yes, yes, now
they became clearer. Reindeer&mdash;a whole herd
of them. What could it mean? Was this a
vision? Was she &ldquo;seeing things,&rdquo; or was it
possible that much higher hills lay over there
and that the reindeer were crossing them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said to her cousin, pointing
away to the clouds.</p>
<p>Together, with bated breaths, they watched
the panorama that moved before them. Now
they saw the herders and their dogs, saw them
run this way and that; saw the herd change its
course, saw the herders again take up the steady
march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, &ldquo;Seems as if you
could hear the crack-crack of reindeer hoofs
and the bark of the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be miles away. It&rsquo;s the Scarberry
herd,&rdquo; said Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; whispered Patsy, &ldquo;the deer are
stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>It was true. Having come to an abrupt halt,
as if facing an insurmountable barrier, the leaders
compelled those that followed to pack in a
solid mass behind them or to spread out to
right or left. In an incredibly short time they
stood out in a straight line, facing east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it must be a river, a river that is still
open, that cannot be crossed,&rdquo; said Marian in
tones of tense excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That our rival has been stopped. Nature
has brought them to a halt. We may win yet.
Let&rsquo;s hurry. We may find a crossing-place in
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look, look over there to the left!&rdquo; cried
Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy.
&ldquo;There were three men. Indians, they looked
like. They seemed to be watching the Scarberry
herd from a hilltop some distance away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; cried Marian. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their great astonishment, the herd had
vanished. As it had appeared to march out of
the clouds, so it seemed now to have receded
again into them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were we dreaming?&rdquo; Patsy asked in an
awed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Marian thoughtfully, &ldquo;It was a
mirage, a mirage of the great white wilderness.
We have them here just as they do on the desert.
By the aid of this mirage, nature has
shown us a great secret; that we still have a
splendid chance to win the race. Let&rsquo;s get down
to camp and be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the three Indians?&rdquo; questioned Patsy.
&ldquo;What were they about to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;We have
little to do with the Scarberry herd. Our task
is that of getting to Fort Jarvis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours were consumed in reaching the
edge of the forest. After that, for hours they
passed through the wonder world of a northern
forest in winter. Deep and still, the snow lay
like a great white blanket. Black as ebonite
against this whiteness stood the fir and spruce
trees. There was something strangely solemn
about the place. The crack of reindeer&rsquo;s hoofs,
the bark of dogs, all seemed strangely out of
place here. It was as though they stood on holy
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a church,&rdquo; Patsy said in an awed
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s great cathedral,&rdquo; answered Marian.</p>
<p>Fortunately the trees were not too close together.
There was room for the deer to pass
between them. So, as before, the herd moved
forward in a fairly compact mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be easy,&rdquo; was Patsy&rsquo;s comment
after three hours had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Marian shook her head in
doubt, &ldquo;I hope so, but you know an Alaskan
who is used to barren hills and tundra, dreads
a forest. I belong to the tundra, so I dread
it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her fears, just at nightfall Marian
found herself passing from beneath the last
spruce tree and gazing away at rolling hills
beyond.</p>
<p>She was just offering up a little prayer of
thanksgiving, when some movement of the forward
herd leaders attracted her attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re stopping,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the vision of the morning flashed
through her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river!&rdquo; she exclaimed in alarm. &ldquo;If&mdash;if
we can&rsquo;t cross it, we&rsquo;ll have to camp at
the edge of the forest. And that is bad, very
bad. Animals that are cowards, and slink away
by day, become daring beasts of prey at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hurried race forward confirmed her worst
suspicions; there, at her feet was a river,
flanked on one side by willows and on the other
by a steep bank. It was not a broad stream&mdash;she
could throw a stone across it&mdash;but it did
flow swiftly. Its powerful current had thus far
defied the winter&rsquo;s fiercest blasts. It was full
to the brim with milky water and crowding
cakes of ice. No creature could brave that
torrent, and live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blocked!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And just when I
was hoping for so much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Sinking down upon the snow, she gave herself
over for a moment to hopeless despair. The
next moment she was on her feet. With arms
outstretched toward the stars as if in appeal for
aid, she spoke through tight clenched teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must! We will! We will win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in mockery of her high resolves, at
that moment there came to her ears the long-drawn
howl of a timber wolf.</p>
<p>The call of the wolf was answered by another,
and yet another. At the moment they seemed
some distance away, but Marian trembled at
the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wolf travels fast,&rdquo; she told herself as
she turned to hurry back to Patsy and her
faithful Eskimo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she came near
to her companions. &ldquo;Sounds like ten or twelve
of them howling at once. Terogloona, do wolves
travel in packs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby not,&rdquo; the Eskimo shrugged his shoulders,
&ldquo;but often they are many. Then they
call to one another. They come all to one place.
Then there&rsquo;s trouble. There will be trouble to-night,
and we have no rifle. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>He broke off abruptly to lean forward in a
listening attitude. &ldquo;That is strange,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;They have found some prey back there
where they are, perhaps a caribou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they stood at strained attention, it became
evident to all that the creature being pursued
was coming down the wind toward them. The
yap-yap of the wolves, now in full pursuit, grew
momentarily louder. At the beginning they had
seemed two miles away. Now they seemed but
one mile; a half mile. The girls fairly held
their breaths as they watched and waited.</p>
<p>And now it seemed that the wolves must be
all but upon them. Then, with a sudden cry,
Marian saw the great spreading antlers of old
Omnap-puk, the king of reindeer and caribou,
rise above the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not alone. There are others,&rdquo; Patsy
breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer!&rdquo; Marian murmured in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>It was true. One by one at first, then by
fives and tens, a drove of deer, fifty or sixty in
number, appeared on the crest of the hill and
came plunging down toward Marian&rsquo;s herd.</p>
<p>The old Monarch had never before joined
their herd, but this time, without a second&rsquo;s
hesitation, he plunged straight on until he came
to the edge of the herd. Then, with a peculiar
whistled challenge, he wheeled about and with
antlers lowered for battle, pawed defiance at
the on-rushing band of wolves.</p>
<p>Then a strange and interesting drama began
to be enacted. There was a shifting and turning
of deer. Front ranks were quickly formed.
When the wolves, with lolling tongues and dripping
jaws reached the spot, they found themselves
facing a solid row of bayonet-like antlers.</p>
<p>Quick as they were to understand the situation,
and to rush away in a circle to execute a
rear attack, the deer, under the monarch&rsquo;s leadership,
were quicker. Other lines were formed
until a complete circle of antlers confronted the
beasts of prey. The weaker and younger deer
were in the center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Then it was that the girls discovered for the
first time that they, too, were in the center;
that they were surrounded by the restless, snorting,
pawing herd of deer. In their interest at
watching the progress of events, they had not
been aware of the fact that the deer, in swinging
about, had encircled them.</p>
<p>That they were in peril, they knew all too
well. They read this in the look of concern on
Terogloona&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circle hold, all right,&rdquo; he said soberly. &ldquo;Not
hold, bad! Deer afraid. Go mad. Want&rsquo;a
trample down all; want&rsquo;a get away fast. Mebby
knock down my master&rsquo;s daughter, her friend,
Terogloona, Attatak; knock down all; mebby
trampled. Mebby die. Mebby wolf kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was apparently nothing to do but wait.
To the wolf pack new numbers appeared to be
added from time to time. The sound of their
yap-yapping came incessantly. The circle
swayed now to this side and now to that as some
frightened deer appeared ready to break away.
It was with the utmost difficulty that the girls
prevented themselves from being knocked down
and trampled under the sharp hoofs of the
surging deer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What will it be like if the circle breaks and
they really stampede?&rdquo; groaned Patsy. For
the first time in her Arctic experience she was
truly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Marian. &ldquo;We can
only trust. I wish we were out of this. I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp exclamation escaped Marian&rsquo;s lips.
Over to the left a deer had gone down. The
wolves appeared to have cut the tendons to his
forelegs. There was terrible confusion. It
seemed that the day was lost, that the stampede
was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep close to me,&rdquo; Marian whispered
bravely. &ldquo;Some way we will pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy gripped her arm for the final struggle.
Then, to her astonishment, she heard the sound
of a shot, then another, and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone to our rescue,&rdquo; cried Marian.
&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />THE MYSTERIOUS DELIVERER</h2>
<p>Accustomed as they were to the presence of
men, the reindeer, not at all frightened by the
shots, held their position in the impregnable
circle. The cowardly wolves began to slink away
at the first shot. It seemed no time at all until
the only sound to be heard was the rattle of
antlers as the deer broke ranks and began to
scatter again for feeding.</p>
<p>Some moments before the girls could make
their way out of the center of the herd the firing
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could it have been?&rdquo; Patsy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;Whoever it
was, we must find them and thank them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>This task she found to be more difficult than
she had supposed. There had doubtless been
tracks left by the strange deliverer, but these
had already been trampled by the deer. Search
as they might, they could find no trace of the
person who had fired the shots. Mute testimony
of his skill as a marksman, two dead wolves
lay on the snow close to the spot where the
defensive circle had been formed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you make of that?&rdquo; Marian asked
at last in great bewilderment. &ldquo;Terogloona,
where could they have gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Canok-ti-ma-na</i>&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know), Terogloona
shook his head soberly.</p>
<p>One of Marian&rsquo;s sleds had been left at the
edge of the forest. Upon returning to this, they
experienced another great surprise. Lying across
the sled was a rifle, and in a pile beside it were
five boxes of cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rifle!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian, seizing it and
drawing it from his leather sheath. &ldquo;A beauty!
And a new one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls sat down on the sled and stared
at one another in speechless silence.</p>
<p>Terogloona and Attatak soon joined them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Indian, the one we saved from
starving!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy at last, &ldquo;I just know
it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terogloona shook his head. &ldquo;Old rifle, mebby
all right,&rdquo; he mumbled; &ldquo;new rifle, mebby Indian
not give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls, not at all convinced that this conclusion
was a correct one, still clung to the
belief that their protector had been the Indian.</p>
<p>Since it was impossible to cross the river, it
was decided that they should make camp at the
edge of the forest; that Terogloona, with the
rifle, was to keep watch over the herd the first
part of the night; and Marian, who was a good
shot, the latter half.</p>
<p>It was while Marian was packing away the
dishes after supper that the piece of old ivory
with the ancient engraving on it, the newest
piece which they had found in the mountain
cave, fell out of her sleeping bag. Without
knowing it, she had saved this, the least of their
treasures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said to Terogloona, who sat
cross-legged before the fire, &ldquo;we found this in
a mountain cave. What does it say? Surely
you can read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time Terogloona studied the crude
picture in silence. When at last he spoke, it was
to inform her that the ivory had once belonged
to his great-uncle; that it told of a very successful
hunt in which twenty caribou had been driven
into a trap and killed with bows and arrows;
that shortly after that they had come upon a
white man with a long beard, starving in a cabin
beside a stream. They had given the man caribou
meat. He had grown strong, then had gone
away. As pay for their kindness he had offered
them heavy yellow pebbles and dust from a
moosehide sack. This they had not taken because
they did not know what it was good for. They
had asked two cups and a knife instead.</p>
<p>As he explained this, the Eskimo showed each
picture that told the part of the story narrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems very real,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;How
long ago could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby twenty years,&rdquo; said Terogloona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white man was a prospector.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the yellow pebbles and dust must have
been gold!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy. &ldquo;Oh, Marian!
If we could find that place we&rsquo;d be rich. Terogloona,
could you find the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Eskimo studied the ancient picture-writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh-eh</i>,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Mebby could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marian! We&rsquo;ll go back,&rdquo; said Patsy,
doing a wild dance on her sleeping bag. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go back for gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present,&rdquo; said Marian, quietly, &ldquo;we
have work enough. We must get our herd to
Fort Jarvis. Looks as if that will be a difficult
enough task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; she turned suddenly to Terogloona,
&ldquo;there were more than fifty reindeer
with old Omnap-puk, were there not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master&rsquo;s herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the deer we have been missing all
winter, the ones we thought had been killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then&mdash;&rdquo; she leaped suddenly to her
feet in her excitement, &ldquo;then those people can
not have killed our deer at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did they follow us? Are they
following us now? What was it they killed
that night, if not our deer? Oh! it&rsquo;s too perplexing
for words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terogloona looked at her and smiled a droll
smile. &ldquo;Many strange things on hill and tundra.
Some time mebby know; mebby not. Terogloona
must go watch; you sleep. To-morrow mebby
very hard.&rdquo; Taking up the rifle, he left the tent.</p>
<p>Before creeping into her sleeping bag, Marian
stepped out of the tent to cool her heated brow
in the crisp night air. Above her the stars
gleamed like tiny camp-fires; beyond her the
dark forest loomed. From the distance she
caught the bump and grind of ice crowding the
banks of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Morning came, and with it the problem of
crossing the river. They had been traveling by
compass. As far as Marian could tell, to go
either up or down the river would be to go out
of their direct path. Terogloona advised going
north. Some signs unintelligible to the girls, but
clear enough to him, appeared to promise a
crossing two or three miles above.</p>
<p>For once the canny instincts of the Eskimo
failed. He was no longer in his own land of
barren hills, tundra and sea; perhaps this caused
him to err. One thing was certain, as they
traveled northward the hills that lined the stream
grew more rugged and rocky, and the river more
turbulent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t find a crossing for miles,&rdquo; Marian
said, with a tone of conviction.</p>
<p>Even Terogloona paused to ponder and scratch
his head.</p>
<p>It was just at the moment when despair
appeared about to take possession of them that
Patsy, chancing to glance away at the hills that
loomed above the opposite banks, suddenly cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! A man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>All looked in the direction she had pointed.
The man was standing perfectly still, but his
right hand was pointing. Like a wooden signboard,
it pointed downstream. Three times the
arm dropped. Three times it was raised to point
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an Indian,&rdquo; said Terogloona, stoically.
&ldquo;It is his country. He knows. We must go
back. The crossing lies in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the man on the hill saw them turn their
herd about and start back, he began to travel
slowly downstream. All that day, and even into
the night, he went before them, showing the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the pillar of fire,&rdquo; said Marian, with a
little choke in her voice.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in her mind that this
benefactor was the Indian they had befriended
when he was starving. To her lips there came
a line she had long known, &ldquo;I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to camp again at the edge of the
forest, they traveled without rest or food for
eight hours. At last, when they were so hungry
and weary that they felt they must drop in their
tracks and fall asleep, they came suddenly to a
place where the troubled rush of waters ceased;
where the river spread out into a broad, quiet,
icebound lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Marian murmured reverently
as she dropped exhausted upon her sled.</p>
<p>After resting and eating a cold lunch of hardtack,
frozen boiled beans, and reindeer steak,
they headed the herd across the lake. Having
passed through the narrow forest that skirted
the lake, they came upon a series of low-lying,
barren hills. Here, in a little gully lined with
willows whose clinging dead leaves rustled incessantly
in the breeze, the girls made camp.</p>
<p>Before going to sleep, Marian walked out into
the night to view her herd. The sky was clear.
The golden moon made the night light as day.
The herd was resting peacefully. She wondered
vaguely if other human beings might be near.
Their mysterious guide had left them at the
shore of the lake. At no time had he come
close enough to be identified. She was wondering
about him, and as her gaze swept the horizon
she saw the red and yellow gleam of a camp-fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Her feeling toward that camp-fire had
changed. There had been a time when it filled
her with fear. Now, as she gazed steadily at it,
it seemed a star of hope, a protecting fire that
was perhaps to go with them all their long
journey through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian&rsquo;s camp, I suppose. And yet,&rdquo;
she asked herself, &ldquo;is it? It might be the tent
of the purple flame, and if it is, do they mean
us good or ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleep that night was long and refreshing.
They awoke next morning with renewed courage.
Before them lay great sweeping stretches of
tundra. For days, without a single new adventure,
they pushed on toward Fort Jarvis. Sometimes,
beside a camp-fire of willows, Marian sat
wondering how they were coming on with their
race. Were Scarberry and his herd nearer the
Fort than they? There was no way to tell.
Traveling the trackless Arctic wilderness is like
sailing the boundless sea. As a thousand ships
might pass you by night or day, so a thousand
herds, taking other courses, might pass this one
on its way to Fort Jarvis and no owner know
of the others passing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Sometimes, too, she thought of those mysterious
camp followers&mdash;the people of the purple
flame. She no longer feared them; was curious
about them, that was all. No longer did she
catch the gleam of their light by night. Had
they turned aside, gone back, or had they merely
extinguished their unusual light?</p>
<p>The Indians, she thought, must have been left
behind. They would not travel far from their
hunting ground. They had been served, and had
served in turn. Now they might safely be
forgotten.</p>
<p>Then there came a time that called for all the
courage and endurance their natures could command.
One night they found themselves camped
among the foothills of a range of mountains.
The mountains, a row of alternating triangles of
deep purple and light yellow, lay away to the
east and at their peaks the snow, tossed high in
air by the incessant gales that blew there, made
each peak seem a smoking volcano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Terogloona, throwing out
his hand in a sweeping gesture, &ldquo;we must
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo; asked Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must do!&rdquo; said Terogloona as he turned to
the task of putting all in readiness.</p>
<p>Two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the following
day found them engaged in a terrific battle with
the blizzard that ever raged up the mountain
pass which they must cross.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Try not the pass,</p>
<p class="t0">The old man said,</p>
<p class="t0">The storm is lowering overhead,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Patsy chanted bravely as, with snow encrusted
head and with cheeks that must be rubbed incessantly
to prevent them from freezing, she
struggled forward.</p>
<p>A moment later, as a fiercer shock seemed
about to lift her from her feet and hurl her
down the mountain side, Marian heard her fairly
shriek into the teeth of the gale:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excelsior! Excelsior!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Many hard battles had Marian fought out on
the tundra, but nothing had ever equalled this.
The snow, seeming never to stop, shot past them,
or in a wild whirling eddy dashed into their
faces. The wind tore at them. Now it came in
rude gusts, and now poured down some narrow
pass with all the force of the waterfall. Only
by bending low and leaping into it could they
make progress.</p>
<p>The herd plunged stumblingly forward in a
broad line. The dogs, incessantly at their heels,
urged them forward. Terogloona, and even the
brave Attatak, did all in their power to keep
the herd moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they stop; oh, if they do!&rdquo; panted Marian.
&ldquo;If they refuse to go on we are lost! If only
we reach the summit I am sure we will be safe.
It must be calm on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Gold, the master collie, completely exhausted
and blinded by the snow, came slinking
back to his mistress. Marian rubbed the snow
from the eyes of the faithful dog and, patting
his side, bade him go back into the fight. Tears
came to her eyes as the dog bravely returned to
his task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The time came at last when all three dogs
seemed done in; when the deer all but stopped;
when it seemed impossible that they might be
kept moving another five minutes. Then it was
that the indomitable Marian sank down upon her
sled in the depths of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; cried Patsy, who had turned
about to rub the frost from her cheeks. &ldquo;Wolves!
A whole pack of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian wheeled about for one look; then,
digging into her pack, drew forth her rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll die fighting!&rdquo; she murmured as she
took steady aim at the foremost member of the
pack that came tearing up the trail.</p>
<p>She was about to press the trigger when
Patsy gave her arm a sudden pull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Wait! Those are not
wolves. They&rsquo;re dogs; great big, wonderful
dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />THE END OF THE TRAIL</h2>
<p>Troops of conflicting hopes and fears waged
battle in Marian&rsquo;s brain when she realized that
the pack approaching them on the run up the
trail in the teeth of the storm were not wolves,
but dogs. There are two types of dogs in Alaska;
one, more wolf than dog, is the native wolf dog.
This type, once he is loosed, leaps at the throat
of the first reindeer he sees. A pack of these
dogs, in such a crisis as the girls were now
facing, would not only destroy many of the
feebly struggling, worn-out and helpless younger
deer, but beyond doubt would drive the remainder
of the herd into such a wild panic as would
lose them to their owners forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Were the dogs of this or the other type&mdash;white
men&rsquo;s dogs, who treat the reindeer as they
might cattle or sheep, and merely bark at them
and drive them forward? If they were white
men&rsquo;s dogs they might save the day; for the
barking of such a pack, as fresh for the struggle
they appeared to be, would doubtless drive the
exhausted deer to renewed efforts and carry
them on over the top.</p>
<p>With bated breath and trembling heart Marian
watched their approach. Once hope fell as she
thought she caught the sharp ki-yi of a wolf dog.
In this she must have been mistaken, for as they
came closer she saw that they were magnificent
shaggy-coated fellows, with an unmistakable
collie strain in their blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;&lsquo;the chariots of the Lord,
and the horsemen thereof.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange expression, but fitted the
occasion so well that Patsy felt her heart give a
great leap of joy.</p>
<p>Indeed the steeds of the Arctic, if not the
horsemen, had come to their aid in a time of
great need, and, passing them with a wild leap,
the dogs burst upon the deer with a rush and
roar that sent them forward by leaps and bounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Staggering forward, the girls followed as best
they could. Now they were a thousand yards
from the summit, now five hundred, now three,
now two. And now the first deer were disappearing
over the top. Enheartened by this,
the others crowded forward until with one final
rush they all passed over the top and started
down on the other side.</p>
<p>Just as the girls reached the crest and were
peering over the summit, a shrill whistle smote
their ears. It sounded again, and yet again.
There was a movement just before them. Then
the snow-covered pack of dogs rushed pel-mel
past them on the back trail down hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone whistled to them. They are going
back. How wonderfully they must be trained!&rdquo;
exclaimed Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were someone&rsquo;s team,&rdquo; Marian said
slowly, as if for the first time realizing they had
not really been sent direct from Heaven to save
them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re somebody&rsquo;s team. He knew we
were in trouble and turned the dogs loose to
help us. I wonder who he could have been?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>For the present the question must remain
unanswered. The herd had gone on before them.
It was all important that they join them. So,
having straightened out the draw-straps to their
sleds, they began making their way down the
hard packed and uncertain descent.</p>
<p>It was not long before they came upon the
herd feeding on a little mountain plateau. Terogloona
was already busy making camp, and
Attatak thawing out food over a fire of tiny
scrub fir trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful to think that the great
struggle is over?&rdquo; whispered Marian, contentedly,
as they lounged on their sleeping bags
an hour later. &ldquo;This is really the worst of it,
I hope. Fort Jarvis can&rsquo;t be more than four
days away now, over a smoother down trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we are in time!&rdquo; sighed Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be. Oh, we must!&rdquo; exclaimed
Marian passionately. &ldquo;Surely it would be too
much to struggle as we have, and then lose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Before Marian fell asleep she set her mind to
meet any outcome of their adventure. She
thought of the wonderful opportunities the sale
of the herd would bring to her father and herself.
Near some splendid school they must rent
a bungalow. There she would keep house for
him and go to school. In her mind she saw the
wonderful roses that bloomed around their door-step,
and pictured the glorious sunsets they
would view from their back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, too,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;Patsy could
live with us for a year or two and attend my
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had pictured all this, she saw in
her mind that the race had been lost; that Scarberry
had sold his herd to the Canadian officials;
that she was to turn the heads of her leading
reindeer toward the home tundra.</p>
<p>With great difficulty at first, but with ever
increasing enthusiasm, in her imagination she
drove the herd all the way back to enter once
more upon the wild, free, life of the herder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really does not matter,&rdquo; she told herself;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s really only for father. He is so lonely
down there all by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>In her heart of hearts she knew that it did
matter, mattered a very great deal indeed. Brave
girl that she was, she only prepared her mind
for the shock that would come if the race were
really lost.</p>
<p>Four days later the two girls found themselves
approaching a small village of log cabins
and long, low-lying buildings. This was Fort
Jarvis. They had made the remainder of the
journey in safety. Leaving their herd some ten
miles from the Fort, where the deer would be
safe, they had tramped in on snowshoes.</p>
<p>Marian found her heart fluttering painfully
as her feet fell in the hard-packed village path.
Had Scarberry been there? Was the race lost?
Had the man of the purple flame been there?
Had he anything to do with the deal?</p>
<p>Twice they asked directions of passing Indians.
At last they knocked at a door. The door swung
open and they found themselves inside a long,
low room. At a table close to an open fire sat
a man in uniform. He rose and bowed as they
came toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are the agent for the Canadian
Government?&rdquo; Marian faltered, addressing the
man in uniform.</p>
<p>The man nodded his head and smiled a little
welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to buy a reindeer herd?&rdquo; Marian
asked the question point-blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; the man answered quietly, &ldquo;that
I have already agreed to purchase one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; Marian sank to a chair.
The shock was too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, the truth is,&rdquo; smiled the Major, as
though there had been no interruption, &ldquo;I believe
I have agreed to purchase your herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My herd!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian, unable to
believe her ears. &ldquo;But how did you know of
my herd&mdash;how did you know I was on the way?
Who told you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time, young lady,&rdquo; laughed
the Major. &ldquo;I think I have a number of surprises
for you. As to your first question, I will
say that I have never heard of your herd until
two days ago. That day, two days after the
great storm, a half famished Indian reached
Fort Jarvis, driving a splendid team of white
men&rsquo;s dogs. They had been hard driven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After we had fed him, he jerkily told us
the story of your race against a man named
Scarberry. He told us of the treatment you had
given him; of your kindnesses to his people.
Then he told of Scarberry. Told how Scarberry&rsquo;s
herd had been delayed and held up along
the trail, and how he had tried to be of help to
you. Then he told of your battle against the
storm, and how, once you were safely over the
pass, he had driven night and day to reach here.
His hope was to get here ahead of any other
herd and intercede for you. Such loyalty is
not to be denied. And I told him that should
your herd reach here in good shape, that I would
give it preference, even should Scarberry get
here ahead of you. I believe that answers one
of your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the world did this Indian know
that the Government had agreed to purchase a
herd?&rdquo; asked Marian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the North,&rdquo; answered the Major, &ldquo;rumor
flies fast, even over seemingly uninhabited places.
And you may depend upon it that the Indian
will know what is going on; even if he does
have but little to say. Now, to business. I understand
you have brought the herd with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Marian, &ldquo;they are at our
camp about ten miles out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may consider the deal closed.
There remains but to count the deer; to weed
out those that are too old or too weak for the
final drive, then to make out your order on our
Government. We have Lapland herders who
will assist in the work. You may rest here
with us until the count is completed. After that
I will see that you have guides and dog-teams
for the passage south to the rail head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, impulsively
leaping to her feet. &ldquo;But Bill Scarberry,&rdquo;
she asked suddenly, &ldquo;did he really win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled the Major, &ldquo;he has not yet been
heard from. So you won the race after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, &ldquo;I could never
have been happy again if we had lost, even if
Marian did sell her herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a night&rsquo;s rest at the post, Marian and
Patsy felt like they had come into a new
life. They had lain awake long into the night,
exchanging excited whispers over their good
luck. The next morning, as Marian was passing
down the street, she noticed a dog team. There
was something about the leader that looked familiar.
One glance at the driver brought an
exclamation of surprise to her lips. He was
none other than the Indian she had saved from
starvation, and who in turn had served as her
guardian angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the dog team that came to our
rescue in the blizzard,&rdquo; was her mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>While she had been told the rest of the story
by the Major, she preferred to have the story
from the man&rsquo;s own lips. She found him very
reluctant to talk, but after his heart had been
warmed by a splendid meal of boiled reindeer
meat and coffee, he told his story from the
time she had given him three of her reindeer
until the present moment. Shortly after leaving
her, he had come in with some of his own people
who were well fed and prosperous. Knowing
that the girls were headed straight for trouble,
and feeling very grateful to them, he had persuaded
one of these, his kinsmen, to go with
him and to follow the reindeer herd with his
team of white men&rsquo;s dogs. It had been they
who had driven the wolf-pack away and had
left a rifle and ammunition for the girls. It was
their dog team that had been released from the
sled and had assisted in driving the reindeer
herd over the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you do all this?&rdquo; Marian asked.</p>
<p>The man looked at her for a moment in silence,
then he asked: &ldquo;Why did you give reindeer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you were in need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; a faint smile played across his
face, &ldquo;you too were in need. Indian all same
white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Marian understood, and her heart was
filled with a new love for all those strange people
who inhabit the White Wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The next day, Marian and Patsy, together
with the Major and his Lapland herders, went
out to Marian&rsquo;s camp and there began the business
of sorting and counting the deer. This
work continued for three days, and on the evening
of the third day, leaving the herd in charge
of the Lapland herders, Marian, Patsy and the
Major, together with Terogloona and Attatak,
started for Fort Jarvis by way of deer sled.</p>
<p>Topping a hill some two miles from Fort Jarvis,
they suddenly came upon a tent. Just before
they reached it, the interior became suddenly
lighted with a strange purple flame. Marian
halted her deer with an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purple flame!&rdquo; she gasped, and turning
to the Major said: &ldquo;I can stand this mystery no
longer. Do you know who is in that tent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I think so,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I
think it is Mr. Montgomery, an old prospector.
He is well known throughout the North. Why
do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to meet him,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;Will
you please come with me to his tent?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>A moment later a hearty old man came to the
door of the tent in response to their call, and
with a cheery smile acknowledged the Major&rsquo;s
introduction of Marian and Patsy, at once inviting
them in.</p>
<p>Imagine Marian&rsquo;s surprise, when upon entering
the tent she saw a young girl of about her
own age, seated at a radio sending set. And
there, under the deft fingers of the girl operator,
a crackling purple flash jumped back and forth
across a wide spark gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl of the purple flame,&rdquo; gasped Patsy.</p>
<p>At sound of her voice the girl turned around
and smiled a welcome. Marian turned to Mr.
Montgomery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are the people of the purple flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we, indeed!&rdquo; laughed the old Prospector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marian, &ldquo;and I thought all the
while, back there in Alaska, that you were
dogging our footsteps, and, to speak honestly, we
feared you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; laughed the old gentleman. &ldquo;So
that was your reindeer camp. We thought all
the while that <i>you</i> were dogging <i>our</i> footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old prospector launched into a long
story that cleared up the entire mystery of the
purple flame.</p>
<p>It appeared that in his youth he had been
a prospector in Alaska and had found a very
rich vein of gold. Ill health had overtaken him
and he had been forced to return to the States.
Years passed, and fortune and wealth had come
to him, but the lure of searching for gold was
still in his veins, and in the end he had come
again to Alaska, thinking to find his mine. The
years had somewhat dimmed his memory, and he
had searched in vein for the lost mine. Moving
from day to day, he had been just as surprised
to note that Marian&rsquo;s camp moved with him as
was Marian to discover that his camp moved
with hers. In time he had become suspicious,
fearing that they were dogging his footsteps. He
knew that he had been well known throughout
the North in the past, and he feared that others
knew of his lost mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Montgomery, &ldquo;is
the reason I never called at your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that radio set,&rdquo; said Marian, &ldquo;with its
flash of purple flame, is the reason that I never
called at your camp. There was something so
mysterious about it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old prospector smiled. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that my having a sending and receiving
radio set is a bit strange and perhaps a little
mysterious. Certainly the set is a bit strange,
for to my knowledge there is not another set
like it in the country. It is very compact and
yet most powerful. You see, my interests in the
outside are very extensive, and it is necessary for
me to keep in touch with them. By the use of
this set, I can keep in touch with my agent in
Nome, and he, in turn, can keep in touch with
the States by use of the cable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the spark of my set, while sending,
that made the purple colored flash which kept you
so mystified. You know, most mysterious things
become quite simple when you find out all about
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This radio has made it possible for me to
come back and look for my lost mine. It&rsquo;s the
lure of the thing that draws me, not the desire
for the gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then it was that Marian, remembering
the treasures that she had found in the cave on
the enchanted mountain, and feeling that she
had something in common with this old prospector,
told him her story.</p>
<p>As she told of the carved ivory, the old man&rsquo;s
eyes glowed with delight, and in the end he insisted
that he go into Fort Jarvis with them that
he might at least see the piece they had brought
along and hear Terogloona&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>At the post old Terogloona, in a halting way,
read the pictured inscription on the four sides.
Other bits of information furnished by Terogloona
convinced the old prospector that Terogloona&rsquo;s
great-uncle had been his guide in the
days when he was first prospecting and had
found the mine. Mr. Montgomery wanted to set
out at once with Terogloona and Attatak for
the cave on the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very near my
lost mine, for I remember that my old guide,
Terogloona&rsquo;s great-uncle, spoke of the cave as
a place where we might winter in safety, should
winter come down upon us before we expected
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;We have
just completed the count and sale of our deer.
Patsy and I are going back to the States, and I
am sure Terogloona and Attatak will go with
you. And you will be in good hands,&rdquo; she added,
giving both of the faithful servants a glowing
smile.</p>
<p>The sale of the deer was successfully completed.
After a much needed rest, the girls began
the long journey to the &ldquo;Outside.&rdquo; So far
were they from the strange cabin of the recluse
musician, they were unable to return for the
treasure they had taken from the mountain cave.</p>
<p>Many months passed, and then one day as the
two girls returned from an afternoon of shopping
in Chicago, Marian found a registered
package awaiting her. From its bulk, and from
the many post-marks upon it, she knew at once
that it contained the long awaited ancient
treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Her fingers trembled as she undid the many
wrappings. When at last she came to the treasure
she found each piece separately wrapped.
The copper instruments and the old ivory pieces
were just as she had found them, tarnished and
blackened with age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she held up before Patsy&rsquo;s
astonished eyes a green bowl which gleamed in
the light like a crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, as she saw her
cousin unpack another and another and yet another,
&ldquo;he has thought your old dishes were
useless and has sent you some of his exquisite
glassware instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; murmured Marian, ready to
cry with disappointment. She had so hoped to
surprise Mr. Cole, the Curator of the Museum,
with rare pieces of ancient pottery such as had
never before been brought from the Arctic; and
here were only four pieces of glassware. How
they had ever come to be here, she could not
guess; but here they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Patsy, &ldquo;What a strange appearance
they have when you hold them to the
light! And see, two of them are blue and two
are a tawny green, like huge cat&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Marian, &ldquo;here is a note from
our aged friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She unfolded it and read it aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please pardon an old man&rsquo;s fancy. I could
not resist the temptation of polishing these
up a bit. The very sight of them makes me
envious. They are indeed a rare find. I have
a guess as to what they are made of, but your
friend the Curator will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; exclaimed Patsy, &ldquo;they are the very
dishes you found in the cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very, very strange! We must have
Mr. Cole come over at once,&rdquo; said Marian, half
beside herself with curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>She raced to the telephone and a moment later
had the Curator on the wire. If you have read
our other book, &ldquo;The Cruise of the O&rsquo;Moo&rdquo; you
will remember that Marian, with her two friends,
Lucile and Florence had once made a rare find
for the Museum, so you will not wonder that so
great a man should hurry right over in answer
to their call.</p>
<p>When he arrived, Marian placed one of the
bowls in his hand with the single comment:
&ldquo;From a cave in a mountain in Alaska.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three minutes he turned the bowl about
before the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to tell you about it?&rdquo;
There was a strange light in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost everything!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian.
&ldquo;What it&rsquo;s made of, who made it, how long ago,
how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit. Not so fast!&rdquo; the Curator held
up a hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know what it&rsquo;s made of,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;What was the Blue God made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that jade, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue and green jade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then the bowls should be valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite decidedly. As for your other questions,
much more information is needed before
we can know who made them and when. So far
as I know, nothing of this kind has ever before
been discovered. Were there any other pieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian held out a handful of ivory pieces.</p>
<p>For ten minutes there was silence in the room,
save for the click of specimens as the Curator
turned them over. Then, turning suddenly, Mr.
Cole put out his hands to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to congratulate you,&rdquo; he said, his
eyes gleaming, &ldquo;upon your good fortune in discovering
the finest collection of specimens ever
brought from Alaska. From its discoloration
this ivory should be at least five hundred years
old. The bowls are doubtless of the same period.
That makes them priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words Marian&rsquo;s joy knew no
bounds. As for Patsy, her unselfish pleasure
in the success of her cousin was quite as great
as if it had been she who had made the find.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>It was arranged that Mr. Cole should take
charge of the specimens, and should advise
Marian in regard to their disposal.</p>
<p>Marian&rsquo;s dream came true. She and her
father secured the bungalow, rose bush and all,
and owned it free from debt. There was money
enough left for her education. As for Patsy, she
was glad enough to hurry back to rejoin her
classmates in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>An unfortunate part of having plenty of
money is that it is likely to shut out from one&rsquo;s
life the thrills that come with a struggle for an
existence. For the time being Marian&rsquo;s life lost
most of its thrills.</p>
<p>Not so, however, with her friend, Lucille
Tucker. You will remember her from reading
&ldquo;The Blue Envelope,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Cruise of the
O&rsquo;Moo&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Secret Mark.&rdquo; Life for her
continued to have thrills a-plenty. Our next
book, &ldquo;The Crimson Thread,&rdquo; will have to do
with the adventures which came to her during
a Christmas vacation. If you think that two
weeks&rsquo; time can contain but few adventures, this
book will prove that you are mistaken.</p>
